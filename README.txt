##### what to do with search/test, artsearch/db.sqlite3 ????

This is the README.txt file for Art Search Exhibit.

The following file paths are relative to ccr/artsearch.

_____ Overall Structure _______________________________________________________

search/scrapers/scrape.py:
    Holds functions that scrape website, including main crawler scrape()
    and helper functions build_...() tailored to each website's html soup
    instructions to add new museum in this file

search/scrapers/parse.py:
    Calls scrape to get information, saves information to search/csvs
    This can be run in main to update everything,
        doing so deletes the pickled search object, which will be automatically
        regenerated by search.py when called by Django
    
search/csvs:
    This directory is where our csv files live
    
search/search.py:
    Reads CSVs to make search object, also reads csvs to get additional information
    Search object gets saved as a pickle as retrieval is faster than generation
    
finder/views.py:
    Django made this file. We added code to pull search object from memory
    It interacts with the user and uses the search object to generate results


_____ Running application _______________________________________________________

1) Make sure you have the following packages installed:
    bs4
    csv
    itertools
    nltk
    numpy
    os
    pandas
    pickle
    re
    requests
    scipy

2) If would like to remake CSV files, type the following in ccr/artsearch/search/scrapers:
    python parse.py
    
   This step is optional, as our repository already includes CSV files used by the search engine.

3) In terminal: run server by typing the following in the directory ccr/artsearch:
    python manage.py runserver
    
4) Go to local host in web browser:
    localhost:8000
    
5) Use search engine, according to usage instructions on webpage.
