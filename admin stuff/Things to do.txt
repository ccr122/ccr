SEARCH / DJANGO INTERACTION

args_from_ui = {
                    'date_lower'    : dd/mm/yyyy        << if we have time
                    'date_upper'    : dd/mm/yyyy        << if we have time
                    'search_terms'  : 'blah blah blah'
                    'Museums'       : ['001','002',...]
                    'order_by'      : 'date_asc' or 'date_dec' or 'search'
                }                                                                   < generated by forms.cleaned() or something
        
search should return:
    ( (Headers), [ (results) ] )                                                    < whoever makes html template gets to decide
    
    ranked by search similarity or by date or something

Our new technology:
    1. Cosine similarity search
    2. Pandas
    3. Django

Other features:
        'more like this' functionality                                              < Casper would really like this feature
            where user clicks on an exhibit and we return similar exhibits
            note we have comparison function which returns list of exhibits
            ordered by cosine similarity. The hard part for this is the Django.
            Maybe we could filter this by date too.
            
        Search by dates? <-- low priority 
            this is quite difficult because we'd have to clean the dates data
            in the csv which is very irregular atm
