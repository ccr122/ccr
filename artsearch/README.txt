This is the README.txt file for Art Search Exhibit.


###   How to run, with already-made CSV:

1) Make sure you have the following packages installed:
    bs4
    csv
    itertools
    nltk
    numpy
    os
    pandas
    pickle
    re
    requests
    scipy

2) If would like to remake CSV files, type the following in ccr/artsearch/search/scrapers:
    python parse.py
    
   This step is optional, as our software already includes CSV files used by the search engine.

3) In terminal: run server by typing the following in the directory ccr/artsearch:
    python manage.py runserver
    
4) Go to local host in web browser:
    localhost:8000
    
5) Use search engine, according to usage instructions on webpage.
