During the 1960s, many artists gravitated toward the brash colors, simplified designs, and direct salesmanship of the burgeoning commercial world and incorporated these same strategies into their fine art practices. Associated with the pop art movement, these artists shocked viewers by attacking the rarity, preciousness, and financial independence that traditionally embodied fine art. Today, however, these icons of pop art are recognized as reflecting a culture in transition, one that was beginning to fully embrace the capitalism and mass communication that characterizes global culture now.\n\nThe exhibition is organized around three separate themes that illustrate many artists\u2019 interests during the 1960s and 1970s: the bustling energy of the street, with its preening passersby, garish signage, and automobile-centric organization; the commercialism that supported and surrounded mass produced consumer products; and the allure of Hollywood glamour and celebrity. Drawn from the MCA Collection and a handful of local loans, these works reveal patterns and preoccupations that connect artists working in otherwise distinct styles and approaches. In the \u201cStreet\u201d section, for instance, photo books by Ed Ruscha are presented with a concrete Cadillac in a collage by Wolf Vostell and a colorful streetwalker in a painting by Ed Paschke. In the \u201cStore,\u201d Andy Warhol\u2019s silk-screened \u201cportraits\u201d of Campbell\u2019s soup cans are joined by papier-mache sculptures of candy by Claes Oldenburg and a painting of an alluring female nude on top of a zebra by Mel Ramos, mimicking an often-used sales strategy in advertising. In the \u201cSilver Screen,\u201d we find glamour of various stripes, including 1950s heartthrob Troy Donahue in Andy Warhol\u2019s painting Troy Diptych and the underground siren pictured in Paschke\u2019s technicolor painting Elcina. The exhibition reveals the richness of the MCA\u2019s holdings in this area of art history as well as the continued relevance and fascination that pop art has for us today.\n\nThis exhibition is organized by James W.

In 2004 he travelled to Bogot\u00e1 and assembled a group of musicians to record a note-for-note instrumental version of the Smiths\u2019s 1987 album The World Won\u2019t Listen. Collins then advertised citywide in radio ads and print media, inviting Smiths fans to perform karaoke versions of their favorite songs. The block-print posters Collins used\u2014similar in design to posters used for political rallies or boxing matches\u2014are included in the exhibition. Colombians showed up in droves to Collins\u2019s recording sessions, and el mundo no escuchar\u00e1 presents a compilation of their passionate performances in front of a series of scenic backdrops. \n\nA first-generation Smiths fan himself, Collins traces the group\u2019s enduring impact across the world in this work, the first in a trilogy of Smiths karaoke videos (the artist made subsequent versions in Turkey and Indonesia) that reveal the universal appeal of the band\u2019s moody pop sensibility and their ability to capture teenage angst and alienation. Though many of the singers are not fluent in English, the album\u2019s lyrics are not lost on them\u2014as evidenced by their moving and vulnerable renditions. During the intimate and transformative act of singing, the karaoke performers transcend language barriers to embody the pathos, signature melancholy sound, and gestures of the band\u2019s lead singer, Morrissey. \n\nel mundo no escuchar\u00e1 makes visible the wide range of emotions the camera provokes, including embarrassment, failure, honesty, sincerity, self-consciousness, anxiety, and sentimentality. Simultaneously revealing pop culture\u2019s ubiquity and the personal meaning each song holds for the performers, Collins contributes to a larger movement in contemporary art\u2014one in which questions of performance intersect with trajectories of identity formation, self-expression, and confession.\n\nThis exhibition is organized by Michelle Puetz, former Andrew W.

Johnston Marklee\u2019s immersive installation further emphasizes the proportions of this grid system by applying a repeating square graphic on the caf\u00e9 walls, as well as creating a gridded ceiling plane that cuts the double height space in half, making for a more intimate scale. This dropped ceiling plane alludes to one idea Johnston Marklee are considering in their redesign of the space, where a mezzanine floor may be inserted into this space to create rooms for art making and meetings above and a social engagement space below.

Rarely making objects from scratch, Da Cunha instead finds wondrously creative ways to repurpose already-existing items, revealing their inherent if overlooked form, beauty, and mystery. For a 2013 exhibition at the MCA, Homebodies, Da Cunha fashioned an undulating wall made with mop heads that mimicked a midcentury modern architectural feature. He has also performed this alchemy with straw hats, plastic soda bottles, umbrellas, and striped awning fabric. For the MCA\u2019s ongoing Plaza Project series, Da Cunha presents objects of a more urban scale to address this particular site.\n\nMix (Americana) (2013) is a full-scale cement mixer liberated from its typical location on the back of a delivery truck. Cleaned up and set on the plaza as an object of beauty, this red-white-and-blue vessel is not only meant to inspire double-takes for visitors passing through the area, it also functions as a strange, quasi-kaleidoscopic viewing device: when viewers peer into its open end, complex shadows, forms, and the depth of the interior chamber are revealed as sunlight filters down into the barrel through a hole in the top.

Originating as a commission from the Racine Art Museum, Wisconsin, which occupies a former department store, Window Dressing was designed for the museum\u2019s six street-level display windows. Four of these six tableaux make their Chicago premiere in this presentation. Each window display consists of an individual sculpture that evokes clothing and accessories set against a backdrop that incorporates the geometric patterns and streamlined curves of the Art Deco period. To seamlessly combine the sculptures with the backdrops, Simpson also crafted stands, platforms, hangers, and other display furniture. Simpson\u2019s ambitious project pays homage to the pioneering window dressers of the early 20th century who developed the field of merchandise display.\n\nSimpson\u2019s manner of working has always been process-driven. She plays with abstraction, figuration, color, and form to create works that fuse material culture and fine art. Inspired by clothing from a wide variety of cultures and eras, Simpson carefully researches and renders these utilitarian items into two-dimensional drawings. She then realizes the final works\u2014which in this presentation include a bowler hat and a woman\u2019s pinafore\u2014in three dimensions, often schematizing or exaggerating their original forms. Hand-constructing the sculptures from a wide range of materials, Simpson cuts, stitches, wraps, folds, ties, and rivets these items together to create the final pieces.

A global movement that encompassed a wide number of art forms, including film, theater, poetry, and literature, Surrealism came of age with poet Andr\u00e9 Breton\u2019s formal declaration in 1924. This deeply emotional and psychological art form flourished in the 1930s and 1940s\u2014turbulent times of economic instability, rapidly changing social mores, and war.\n\nChicago collectors brought the European visual arts aspect of Surrealism to their hometown. Joseph and Jory Shapiro and Edwin and Lindy Bergman traveled to Europe, where they met members of the Surrealist group including Paul Delvaux, Matta, and Magritte, piquing their interest in this \u201cart of the irrational.\u201d Mary and Earle Ludgin collected in depth the works of eccentric American painter Forrest Bess. These arts patrons were among the founders of the MCA, and when the museum began collecting in the mid-1970s, they donated major works by those we now consider \u201cclassical\u201d Surrealists, forming an early and continuing collection strength. These artworks also proved inspirational to generations of Chicago-based artists, from the immediate postwar group dubbed the Monster Roster to the Hairy Who and others, a further expression of the continuing lure of \u201cthe conjured life\u201d that results in strange, often magical, and sometimes disturbing, imagery.\n\nThough often framed as a largely historical movement, the freedom afforded by Surrealism to explore both formal issues\u2014including experimenting with new materials and techniques\u2014and personal expression has continued to inspire artists to the present day. Thus besides presenting works by the founders of the movement, the surrealist tendency is traced in two other groupings: Surrealist-related works from the 1950s to the present, and Chicago connections. Artists including Balthus, Leonora Carrington, and Dorothea Tanning round out the presentation of the classical Surrealists. Major international contemporary artists such as Lee Bontecou, Mark Grotjahn, Wangechi Mutu, Cindy Sherman, and Francesca Woodman represent the stylistically diverse Surrealist-related grouping. Chicago-based artists on view include Gertrude Abercrombie, Leon Golub, Jim Nutt, Christina Ramberg, and H. C. Westermann.\n\nThe exhibition highlights one of the most traditional values in the visual arts: looking. All of the artworks that populate The Conjured Life bear close scrutiny, both in observing and exploring the subject matter and noting the various visual strategies and formal means, from the straightforward representation of Magritte to the low-relief plaster technique of Max Ernst; from the shamanistic deer skin, wood, and felt used by Jimmie Durham to the full-size rubber life raft cast in bronze by Jeff Koons.\n\nThe exhibition is curated by Lynne Warren, Curator at the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago.\n\nThe exhibition is presented in the Bergman Family Gallery, Lindy and Edwin A.

When the musicians are away, video and audio provide viewers with inside access to their process of making music.\n\nFounded in 1996 at Oberlin College, eighth blackbird has developed a style of music that is sometimes called \u201cnew music\u201d or \u201ccontemporary classical.\u201d It can also be described as notated music, performed by classically trained musicians who draw on varied influences ranging from indie rock to medieval music to African drumming. eighth blackbird commissions composers to write new music, then prepares, rehearses, curates, and presents that music for audiences. Unique to their approach is the desire to create visually compelling shows by working with both visual and performance artists to create innovative musical experiences.\n\nFor the eighth blackbird residency, the museum\u2019s third-floor galleries are divided into two distinct areas: a rehearsal room and a space for visitor engagement. When the musicians are rehearsing, visitors can witness their creative process in real time. When the eighth blackbird musicians are away, a video projection covers the walls, providing visitors an intimate look into a rehearsal of David Lang\u2019s these broken wings. In addition to the video, an audio recording captures studio preparations and discussions during the group\u2019s rehearsals and forthcoming concerts. Instruments and scores also inhabit the space when the artists are not on site.\n\nThe adjacent gallery is transformed into a space for visitors to explore how to listen to and engage with new music. It features an installation inspired by John Cage\u2019s Child of Tree (1975) in which plant materials are used as percussive instruments. Visitors are encouraged to play the amplified instruments and ponder the question: What is music? Archival materials sourced in collaboration with the music library at Northwestern University tell the larger story of contemporary music and how early practitioners sought to break down the boundaries between composer, musician, and audience.\n\nEach year since 2011, the MCA has invited an artist (or artists) to serve as a catalyst and engage with the community in projects and timely discussions.

Pop Art Design, an exhibition organized by the Vitra Design Museum, one of the preeminent furniture and design museums in the world, pairs iconic design objects with artworks from this celebrated era to show the cross-pollination between these creative worlds. This glimpse outside the precincts of fine art museums and galleries reinforces the pervasiveness of pop as a cultural phenomenon during this period. Designers such as Charles Eames, George Nelson, Ettore Sottsass, Achille Castiglioni, and Robert Venturi were just as enamored of the commercial buzz of Main Street as their fine art peers and equally embraced the banality of everyday objects, the vivid colors of advertising, and standardized fabrication at the heart of mass consumer products in the creation of their work. Their furniture, graphic design, and architecture exemplify the same pop spirit that swept the western world during this period, but have up until this point not received the attention they deserve.

Gathering a body of work produced over the last two decades, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAl-ugh-ories\u00e2\u0080\u009d pays special attention to the symbolic nature of her depictions of individuals and groups and highlights how the allegorical permeates her oeuvre and fluidly ties the fictional to the autobiographical. Considering Eisenman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dedication to the history of painting and the ways in which she references artists as diverse as Giotto, Francisco de Goya, Paul C\u00c3\u00a9zanne, Pablo Picasso, and Edvard Munch, the show will also underline how her approach to painting involves a deliberate attempt to counter accepted historical hierarchies through wit and irreverence. Her preoccupation with the figure and the complexity of its gestures and form has in recent years also resulted in a number of large-scale plaster sculptures, a selection of which will be included in this show. With proportions that exceed human scale, these bodies\u00e2\u0080\u0094like those in Eisenman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s paintings\u00e2\u0080\u0094act out familiar everyday occurrences such as eating, sleeping, walking, or making love, while also exposing human desire to be equally raw and awkward.\n\n\tNicole Eisenman was born in Verdun, France, in 1965 and lives and works in New York.

Her projects transform the remnants of dysfunctional commercial culture, revealing the inherent problems as well as the latent aesthetic potential within inner-city ruin. Often using laborious fabrication processes in collaboration with local artisans, Camil deaccelerates the frenetic pace of mass commodification through the handcrafted production and intimate quality of her works. In recent projects, she has expanded the scope of her practice to create theatrical environments that invite the viewer to navigate the exhibition space and experience shifting viewpoints and juxtapositions.\n\n\tFor \u00e2\u0080\u009cA Pot for a Latch,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Camil presents a participatory sculptural installation produced specifically for the Lobby Gallery. Inspired by the modular display systems typically used by vendors, Camil has constructed a succession of gridwall panels of her own design, complete with built-in hooks, shelves, and other fixtures for displaying items. Composed of grids, lines, and geometric shapes, the structures form a volumetric drawing within the space of the gallery, referencing cheap commercial constructions as well as the serial patterning of paintings and sculptures made by Minimalist artists such as Sol LeWitt and Agnes Martin.\n\n\tThe title of the exhibition refers to the potlatch, a ceremonial gift-giving festival practiced by the Native-American peoples of the Pacific Northwest coast, for whom it continues to be a system of wealth redistribution. Camil invites the public to participate in the ongoing creation of her piece on designated days, during which visitors are encouraged to exchange their own unique items for others in the installation. The composition on the gridwall panels is thereby in flux and is repeatedly altered throughout the course of the exhibition. With \u00e2\u0080\u009cA Pot for a Latch,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Camil transforms the Lobby Gallery into a shop of sorts, in which the monetary value of an object is supplanted by its personal history and significance.\n\n\tNew Museum visitors are invited to exchange items for those in the installation during a series of six public events.\n\n\tThursday December 17, 5\u00e2\u0080\u00939 PM\nDuring the first event, visitors were able to swap their items for a limited-edition sweatshirt designed by Pia Camil in collaboration with Lorena Vega.\n\n\tOn subsequent days, participants\u00e2\u0080\u0099 items will be exchanged for those items that are installed in the Lobby Gallery on that particular day.\n\n\tSunday February 7, 2\u00e2\u0080\u00934 PM\nSunday February 21, 2\u00e2\u0080\u00934 PM\nSunday March 6, 2\u00e2\u0080\u00934 PM\nSunday March 20, 2\u00e2\u0080\u00934 PM\nSunday April 3, 2\u00e2\u0080\u00934 PM\n\n\tArtist\u00e2\u0080\u0099s invitation:\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA Pot for a Latch\u00e2\u0080\u009d is an invitation to exchange. \n\n\tThe object you bring is a talisman of sorts, and it should be thought of in the same way that the ancient Romans conceived of in their term \u00e2\u0080\u009cres,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which denotes a gift that has both a personal value and a history.

Dark and unsettling, her works often allude to her own personal history or expose or challenge the vulnerability of the human body through threatening contraptions, architectures, and figures. Ursuta\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most recent sculpture series, Whites (2015), takes the form of anthropomorphic white obelisks\u00e2\u0080\u0094with eye sockets and nostrils cast from human skulls. These austere, ghost-like figures, which collectively resemble a group of gravestones, are seated on chairs whose designs reference periods of European colonialism. In Commerce Exterieur Mondial Sentimental (2012), two life-size marble figures adorned with coins gaze defiantly at the viewer. Informed by a socialist-realist aesthetic and a news image of a Roma woman being deported from France, they evoke lifeless mannequins trapped in an economy in which the value of both human beings and commodities are determined by foreign powers.

For Of what is, that it is; of what is not, that it is not (2012), the artist\u00e2\u0080\u0099s commission for dOCUMENTA (13), Macuga presented two tapestries that were shown simultaneously in two separate locations: Kassel, Germany, and Kabul, Afghanistan. The two black-and-white panels, with their composite stitching-together of figures from disparate yet interlocking communities, illuminate the elusive relationship between historic documentation and truth. In Preparatory Notes for a Chicago Comedy (2014) Macuga expands on the function of demonstration and performance in her tapestries, presenting a stage set for a production based on an unpublished play by eccentric German art historian Aby Warburg. As with many of Macuga\u00e2\u0080\u0099s projects, this piece explores the complicated and oftentimes fraught relationship between art and society throughout history that continues to resonate in the present. \n\n\tGoshka Macuga was born in 1967 in Warsaw, Poland, and lives and works in London.

Since the early 2000s, his video works have probed the psychological effects of acoustic experiences, embracing both music and sound as languages capable of conjuring up images, rousing nostalgia, and communicating emotions. In subtle visual narratives, Sala often depicts what appear to be fragments of everyday life, and his intimate observations experiment with fiction to double as enigmatic portraits of society. \n\n\tSince the mid-2000s, Sala\u2019s works have featured musicians in both films and live performances: In films such as Long Sorrow (2005) and Answer Me (2008), musicians intone requiems for the failed histories dormant in the architecture surrounding them. In Le Clash (2010), and Tlatelolco Clash (2011), organ-grinders stroll deserted streets, amplifying a sense of alienation and uncertainty with their unexpected interpretations of a familiar song. The exhibition also includes a recurring live performance entitled 3-2-1 (2011/16), in which saxophonist Andr\u00c3\u00a9 Vida improvises alongside musician Jemeel Moondoc\u00e2\u0080\u0099s recorded lamentation in Long Sorrow, expanding on the dynamics of free-jazz in a duet that changes with each recital. Throughout these works, music resounds as both a cathartic release and an incantation that evokes historical chapters that are neither distant nor closed. \n\n\tIn recent works, Sala has interpreted musical compositions in multichannel video and sound installations that emphasize the perception of sound in relation to architectural spaces. This exhibition features a new spatialization of Sala\u00e2\u0080\u0099s The Present Moment (in B-flat) (2014) and The Present Moment (in D) (2014), in which he rearranges Arnold Schoenberg\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cVerkl\u00c3\u00a4rte Nacht\u00e2\u0080\u009d [Transfigured Night] (1899) to create the sense that individual notes, abstracted from the composition, travel freely throughout the gallery before accumulating and playing in repetition as if trapped in a spatial impasse. The exhibition also includes the US premiere of Sala\u00e2\u0080\u0099s striking installation \u00e2\u0080\u009cRavel Ravel Unravel\u00e2\u0080\u009d (2013), first exhibited at the 55th Venice Biennale, where Sala represented France. In Ravel Ravel (2013), two interpretations of Maurice Ravel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cPiano Concerto for the Left Hand in D-major\u00e2\u0080\u009d (1929\u00e2\u0080\u009330) are projected simultaneously in a semi-anechoic chamber, a space designed to absorb sound. Sala recomposed the tempo of the concerto for each musician so that the two performances progress in and out of sync to produce the perception of musical echoes\u00e2\u0080\u0094a paradoxical experience in a space in which actual echoes are impossible. The dynamics of repetition and reverberation\u00e2\u0080\u0094rhetorical and compositional tropes in Sala\u00e2\u0080\u0099s works\u00e2\u0080\u0094underpin the ideas explored in the exhibition and enrich the historical dialogues embedded throughout the artist\u00e2\u0080\u0099s oeuvre.\n\n\tAnri Sala was born in 1974 in Tirana, Albania, and lives and works in Berlin.

In the mid-1870s, Degas was introduced to the monotype process\u2014drawing in ink on a metal plate that was then run through a press, typically resulting in a single print. Captivated by the monotype\u2019s potential, he immersed in the technique with enormous enthusiasm, taking the medium to radical ends. He expanded the possibilities of drawing, created surfaces with a heightened sense of tactility, and invented new means for new subjects, from dancers in motion to the radiance of electric light, from women in intimate settings to meteorological effects in nature. The monotype also sparked a host of experiments for Degas, who often used the medium as a starting point from which an image could be reworked and revised. This process of repetition and transformation, mirroring and reversal, allowed Degas to extend his approach to the study of form. The profound impact of his work with monotype can be seen in his variations in different mediums of key motifs, revealing a new kind of artwork that was less about progress or completion than endless innovation. \n\nThe exhibition includes approximately 120 rarely seen monotypes\u2014along with some 50 related paintings, drawings, pastels, sketchbooks, and prints\u2014that show Degas at his most modern, capturing the spirit of urban life; depicting the body in new and daring ways; liberating mark-making from tradition; and boldly engaging the possibilities of abstraction.", "date": "March 26\u2013July 24, 2016", "url": "http://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/1613?locale=en", "title": "Edgar Degas: A Strange New Beauty"}, "00404": {"desc": "The years surrounding World War II posed a creative and existential crisis, as artists struggled to respond to human, social, and cultural conditions in the wake of the horrors of combat, images of concentration camps, and the aftermath of the atomic bomb.

An early practitioner of found-object assemblage, his relief and free-standing sculptural objects, such as CHILD (1959) and LOOKING GLASS (1964), were widely recognized for their masterful compositions and daringly dark subject matter.\n\nEqually a pioneer of avant-garde filmmaking, Conner developed a quick-cut method of editing that defined his oeuvre.

Identical in scale and yet distinct from the original, that second work is now one of the icons of the Art Institute\u2019s permanent collection. Van Gogh created a smaller third version, now at the Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay in Paris, as a gift for his mother and sister a few weeks after making the second. While the three paintings at first appear almost identical, when examined closely, each reveals distinct and unique details.\nThis exhibition is the first to truly delve into the fascinating history of these three paintings. Beginning with Van Gogh\u2019s early canvases of cottages and birds\u2019 nests, the show explores the artist\u2019s use of the motif of home\u2014as haven, creative chamber, and physical reality\u2014and follows the evolution of this theme throughout his career, beyond the Yellow House to the asylum at Saint-R\u00e9my. The presentation concludes with Van Gogh\u2019s final residence in Auvers-sur-Oise, where he once again painted a series of cottages\u2014returning to the idea that first evoked in him a sense of home.\nVan Gogh\u2019s Bedrooms features approximately 36 works by the artist, including paintings, drawings, and illustrated letters, as well as a selection of books and other ephemera known to have been in Van Gogh\u2019s possession. Enhancing the exploration of the artist\u2019s works and his longing for a place of his own are several engaging interactive presentations. A digitally enhanced reconstruction of his bedroom allows viewers the chance to experience his state of mind and the physical reality of the space that so inspired him, while other enriching digital components bring to light significant recent scientific research on the three Bedroom paintings. The result is an innovative yet intimate look at one of the most beloved and often-misunderstood artists of all time.\nSponsorsLead support has been provided by the Estate of Jacquet McConville.\nMajor support has been generously provided by Caryn and King Harris, The Harris Family Foundation; the Gilchrist Foundation; The Morris and Dolores Kohl Kaplan Fund; and Evonne and John Yonover. \u00a0\u00a0 Additional funding has been contributed by Constance and David Coolidge, the Mason Foundation, Charlene and Mark Novak, and the Comer Family Foundation. \u00a0Annual support for Art Institute exhibitions is provided by the Exhibitions Trust: Kenneth Griffin, Robert M. and Diane v.S.

Generously donated by Chicago collectors Stefan Edlis and Gael Neeson, these 44 paintings, sculptures, and photographs transform the museum\u2019s presentation of contemporary art, bringing new depth and perspective to the Art Institute\u2019s already strong holdings and making this collection the strongest of any encyclopedic art museum in the world.\n\nThe Art Institute has been committed to collecting and exhibiting contemporary art since the museum\u2019s founding in the 19th century, when Impressionism was considered \u201ccontemporary.\u201d Our rich collections today are largely the result of the generosity and vision of private collectors who have chosen to become great benefactors, and the Edlis/Neeson gift is the latest chapter in this long legacy of patronage and support.\nTheir gift charts the course of the most adventurous art movements since the 1950s, primarily in the United States, beginning with the work of Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg, and Cy Twombly, who began to forge a path out of Abstract Expressionism toward Pop Art with the use of images, materials, and techniques from mass media and found objects. Pop itself is represented in the gift by a landmark group of works by Andy Warhol\u2014including two self-portraits\u2014and signature works by Roy Lichtenstein. The collection also chronicles the significant and enduring influence of Pop Art on later generations of artists, including the virtuouso painter Gerhard Richter, the photography-based critiques of Richard Prince and Cindy Sherman, and the pop-culture riffs of Katharina Fritsch, Jeff Koons, and Takashi Murakami.\nThe Art Institute is a collection of collections, each compelling on its own terms yet capable of telling richer, more extraordinary stories when brought into dialogue. To be sure, the Art Institute of Chicago\u2014and the stories we tell\u2014have been made far greater by Stefan Edlis and Gael Neeson\u2019s gift, an extraordinary benefaction to the city, and, indeed, to the world.", "date": "Ongoing", "url": "http://www.artic.edu/exhibition/new-contemporary", "title": "The New Contemporary"}, "00107": {"desc": "Alfred Stieglitz (American, 1864\u20131946) tirelessly promoted photography as a fine art. Through his own photographic work over the course of a half-century, the photographic journals he edited and published, and the New York galleries at which he organized exhibitions of photographs, paintings, and sculpture, Stieglitz showed photography to be an integral part of modern art in America. In a search for artistic ancestors, he looked intently at photography of the 19th century, most notably that of Julia Margaret Cameron and the Scottish duo David Octavius Hill and Robert Adamson. Their work resonated for Pictorialism, a movement that valued painterly, handcrafted images, and these earlier photographs were exhibited and reprinted for new audiences. Stieglitz\u2019s fledgling interest to create a history of photography as an art form was also evidenced in his decision, later in his career, to revisit his own prior output, reprinting earlier images in a high modernist style.\n\nThe Stieglitz collection at the Art Institute includes several later Cameron and Hill and Adamson prints along with important works by Stieglitz himself, Edward Steichen, and other Pictorialist artists. Drawn entirely from the permanent collection, this exhibition examines how 19th-century photographs influenced Pictorialist practice. Fostering close looking at different photographic processes\u2014from salt and albumen prints of the 19th century, to carbon prints and photogravures of turn-of-the-century reproduction, to crisp gelatin silver prints of the modernist period\u2014it shows Stieglitz and his circle in the context of a changing photographic history.\n\n\n\nRelated MediaLearn more with this glossary of photographic printing processes.\n\n\n\n\nSponsorsLead support for the exhibition is provided by the Black Dog Fund.

Lesser known is the extensive iterative process of drawing and printmaking that is essential to the artist\u2019s studio practice. This exhibition is the first to draw back the curtain on that practice. Featuring over 100 drawings and prints as well as 12 sculptures\u2014many borrowed directly from the artist and never displayed before\u2014the presentation offers an unprecedented look into Puryear\u2019s inspirations, methods, and transformative process.Martin Puryear has had a long relationship with Chicago and the Art Institute. He lived in the city for 12 years, \u2028and the museum has long been supportive of his work\u2014acquiring key pieces in the 1980s, organizing an extensive survey in 1991, and conserving many of his fire-damaged early prints and drawings after that show. Puryear has responded in kind, giving the museum a double-sided drawing for his sculpture Sanctuary and participating \u2028generously and closely in the development of this exhibition, including loaning many works that he has never shared publicly before.\nRelated Media\nWatch a conversation between Martin Puryear and Theaster Gates.\nUniting these rarely seen drawings, several sculptures, and selections from his sketchbooks, Martin Puryear: Multiple Dimensions traces the artist\u2019s career from his student days at Catholic University in the early 1960s through the present, with works created as recently as 2014. Critical to Puryear\u2019s development were his formative years spent with the Peace Corps in Sierra Leone (1964\u20131966), a period in which he was inspired by and gave expression to buildings, flora, insects, animals, and children\u2014the entirety of his environment. Since then, Puryear has returned to many of these themes, experimenting with scale, materials, and varying levels of abstraction. In the exhibition, visitors can witness \u2028this evolution of thought\u2014how a sketch of a house in Sierra Leone is transformed 10 years later into an abstracted proto-sculptural form, or how a head-like shape is reworked in bronze, wood, black Cont\u00e9 crayon, and graphite.By bringing to life the artist\u2019s uncanny ability to make forms that are suggestive, playful, and transformative, all while remaining anchored in the world, this display of Puryear\u2019s explorations across visual ideas and media offers a 360-degree view of the creative process of a contemporary master.\nSponsors\nMartin Puryear: Multiple Dimensions is organized by the Art Institute of Chicago.\nSupport for the exhibition is provided by the Morton International Exhibition Fund and the Kemper Educational and Charitable Fund.\nAnnual support for Art Institute exhibitions is provided by the Exhibitions Trust: Kenneth Griffin, Robert M. and Diane v.S.

They employed unique techniques to build furniture that was like their faith: honest, simple, and humble. Featuring over 20 such objects generously loaned by collectors Thomas and Jan Pavlovic, this exhibition\u2014the first of its kind at the Art Institute\u2014shows the range of items made by the Shakers in the late 18th and 19th centuries. Presented within the chronology of the permanent collection galleries, the exhibition considers Shakers in the larger context of American furniture production, demonstrating the artistic exchange and innovation that defined the country\u2019s early history.\u00a0\nShakers were well known for their austere and rigid lifestyle. Believers lived in separate men\u2019s and women\u2019s dormitories and practiced celibacy and communal ownership. Their worship, however, could be quite lively; the name Shaker derives from the frenzied, whirling dancing that took place at services. Following the arrival of the first Shakers from England in 1774, the group peaked in the mid-19th century, boasting more than 6,000 members from Maine to Kentucky. Though only one Shaker community survives today, the impact of Shakers on American culture has endured, particularly in art and design.

This art history\u2013changing series of over 100 portrait prints radically depicted artists on par with the most significant monarchs, diplomats, and scholars of the day. Presenting several etchings from the Iconography\u2014on view for the first time in nearly 90 years\u2014together with works by various artists from the 16th through the 2oth century, this exhibition examines Van Dyck\u2019s lasting influence on the evolution of the portrait print and its significance as a distinct genre.\nThough already celebrated internationally for his work as a painter, Van Dyck contributed directly to the Iconography series, producing 15 etchings with his own hands. In many other cases, printmaking specialists and collaborators such as Lucas Vorsterman (1595\u20131675) and Paulus Pontius (1603\u201358) realized prints for the series based on Van Dyck\u2019s drawn or painted designs. The Art Institute of Chicago is fortunate to own all of the etchings that Van Dyck made along with several prints from the series designed by the artist and produced by his hired printmakers. Despite the significance of these etchings to Van Dyck\u2019s career and their importance to the history of portraiture\u2014and indeed to the history of printmaking\u2014these works have not been exhibited publicly at the Art Institute since they first entered the collection in 1929, and their impact on the broader field of the portrait print has not yet been fully examined.\nComprising approximately 140 works, including selected subjects from Van Dyck\u2019s Iconography, this exhibition features prints from five centuries. The earliest works, by artists such as Albrecht Du\u0308rer (1471\u20131528) and Hendrick Goltzius (1558\u20131617), precede Van Dyck\u2019s career, while portraits by Rembrandt van Rijn (1606\u201369) and Jan Lievens (1607\u201374), artists who followed Van Dyck, demonstrate his immediate influence. Continuing to follow Van Dyck\u2019s impact on the genre are works by artists such as Francisco de Goya (1746\u20131828), Edgar Degas (1834\u20131917), K\u00e4the Kollwitz (1867\u20131945), and Chuck Close (born 1940). Adding to the presentation is a gallery that explores the political role of the portrait print as well as one devoted to portraits created in various media during the 17th century\u2014drawings, painted miniatures, wax and marble sculptures, and paintings of an intimate scale\u2014all highlighting the unique qualities of the portrait print.\nCatalogueA full-color publication of approximately 112 pages accompanies this exhibition.\u00a0\nSponsorsSupport for Van Dyck, Rembrandt, and the Portrait Print is generously provided by Alan Templeton and Prince Charitable Trusts.\nThe colloquium has been sponsored by the Allan McNab Endowed Fund.", "date": "Through August 7, 2016", "url": "http://www.artic.edu/exhibition/van-dyck-rembrandt-and-portrait-print", "title": "Van Dyck, Rembrandt, and the Portrait Print"}, "00105": {"desc": "In Nothing Personal, works by three American artists come together in a show about the passage from personhood to persona.\nThe 82 photographs that make up The Fae Richards Archive provide a convincing record of a person who never existed. Fae Richards could have been an actress and singer who worked from the 1920s to the 1970s. She was black, gay, and talented, and she achieved success to the degree that circumstances permitted. Zoe Leonard meticulously prepared a mix of publicity shots, film stills, and personal photos to create this fictional archive. She researched historically appropriate photographic papers, and \u201ccast\u201d different printers as well, to guard against a uniform look. The results show happiness tinged with melancholy and ask us to think about what it means to go through life behaving as a credible facsimile.\nThe 70 black-and-white photographs in Cindy Sherman\u2019s series Untitled Film Stills constitute a major contribution to contemporary art. At 8 \u00d7 10 inches, Sherman\u2019s prints look like ordinary film stills: publicity images that stage scenes from a movie for press and other promotional uses. In fact, Sherman did not re-create any specific character or movie. Her one-person show, modeled mainly on European art-house cinema, features a range of postwar genres and female roles that the artist inhabits like a shadow. \u201cThe characters weren\u2019t just airhead actresses,\u201d Sherman has said. \u201cThe clothes make them seem a certain way, but then you look at their expression and wonder if maybe \u2018they\u2019 are not what the clothes are communicating.\u201d\nLorna Simpson\u2019s fifth video work, Corridor, compares two historical periods: the mid-19th and the mid-20th centuries. Two characters, each alone in her domestic world, bring these moments to life, moving in parallel or in tandem through their respective daily routines. One appears to be a household servant or freed slave from around 1860, the other a successful homeowner living one century later\u2014yet both are played by a single person, the artist Wangechi Mutu. The soundtrack, composed by John Davis, similarly contrasts a variety of musical sources, including echoes of \u201cThe Battle Hymn of the Republic,\u201d Chopinesque piano, New Orleans dirges, and free jazz. Using sounds instead of words, the two characters\u2014who are and are not the same woman\u2014carry on a dialogue across the divide of time and circumstance.\nSponsors\nGenerous in-kind support for this exhibition is provided by Tru Vue, Inc. and Gemini Moulding, Inc.", "date": "Through May 1, 2016", "url": "http://www.artic.edu/exhibition/nothing-personal-zoe-leonard-cindy-sherman-lorna-simpson", "title": "Nothing Personal: Zoe Leonard, Cindy Sherman, Lorna Simpson"}}}
