00105,In Nothing Personal, works by three American artists come together in a show about the passage from personhood to persona.
The 82 photographs that make up The Fae Richards Archive provide a convincing record of a person who never existed. Fae Richards could have been an actress and singer who worked from the 1920s to the 1970s. She was black, gay, and talented, and she achieved success to the degree that circumstances permitted. Zoe Leonard meticulously prepared a mix of publicity shots, film stills, and personal photos to create this fictional archive. She researched historically appropriate photographic papers, and “cast” different printers as well, to guard against a uniform look. The results show happiness tinged with melancholy and ask us to think about what it means to go through life behaving as a credible facsimile.
The 70 black-and-white photographs in Cindy Sherman’s series Untitled Film Stills constitute a major contribution to contemporary art. At 8 × 10 inches, Sherman’s prints look like ordinary film stills: publicity images that stage scenes from a movie for press and other promotional uses. In fact, Sherman did not re-create any specific character or movie. Her one-person show, modeled mainly on European art-house cinema, features a range of postwar genres and female roles that the artist inhabits like a shadow. “The characters weren’t just airhead actresses,” Sherman has said. “The clothes make them seem a certain way, but then you look at their expression and wonder if maybe ‘they’ are not what the clothes are communicating.”
Lorna Simpson’s fifth video work, Corridor, compares two historical periods: the mid-19th and the mid-20th centuries. Two characters, each alone in her domestic world, bring these moments to life, moving in parallel or in tandem through their respective daily routines. One appears to be a household servant or freed slave from around 1860, the other a successful homeowner living one century later—yet both are played by a single person, the artist Wangechi Mutu. The soundtrack, composed by John Davis, similarly contrasts a variety of musical sources, including echoes of “The Battle Hymn of the Republic,” Chopinesque piano, New Orleans dirges, and free jazz. Using sounds instead of words, the two characters—who are and are not the same woman—carry on a dialogue across the divide of time and circumstance.

00106,The School of the Art Institute (SAIC) and the Art Institute of Chicago museum have long shared a symbiotic relationship—one institution training artists and the other establishing an encyclopedic collection of works of art for artists and the public alike to study and enjoy. Since the Art Institute’s earliest days, students have enjoyed spending class time in the galleries and have found inspiration in the museum’s collection. Today, the museum is fortunate to count a great deal of works by SAIC alumni among its holdings.
To celebrate the long association between the museum and the school, Homegrown features approximately 120 objects, primarily works on paper, from the Art Institute’s collection made by artists who attended SAIC. Beginning with the early 20th century and organized by decade, the display presents works by some of the most illustrious SAIC-educated artists while also prominently featuring pieces by those whose tenure at the school has at times been overlooked. Highlights include 20 iconic self-portraits by Ivan Albright (1897–1983), created at the end his career using a variety of drawing and painting media, and a selection of color woodblock prints by Gustave Baumann (1881–1971), a Santa Fe–based artist, designer, and letterpress printer who studied at SAIC as a teenager. Also included are the sketchbooks of Margo Hoff and LeRoy Neiman; Neiman’s drawings of Chicago’s Oak Street Beach, in particular, showcase the glitterati of a period typified by Hugh Hefner’s founding of Playboy in the city in 1953. Pieces by the so-called Monster Roster artists who matured in the late-1940s and early 1950s—including Cosmo Campoli, Leon Golub, and Nancy Spero—and Imagist and Hairy Who artists such as Gladys Nilsson, Suellen Rocca, Sarah Canright, and Christina Ramberg, along with a variety of more recent works, round out the selections. Nilsson’s Big School Picture; Little Paper Mural, commissioned by SAIC to be used as a poster advertising the school, serves as a particularly witty, beautiful example of the artist’s work in its maturity.
That the school has produced such a range and wealth of talented artists over the years and that the museum has been able to acquire so much of this work to share are truly causes for celebration. The Art Institute of Chicago invites you to experience and explore the best of Chicago’s very own—works by artists “homegrown” here on Michigan Avenue.

00111,While the Art Institute has a long tradition of collecting and displaying works from the pre-Hispanic cultures of South America, this long-term installation offers the museum’s first presentation of work from the viceregal period. Fourteen paintings and related works on paper—including pieces from the collection of Chicagoans Marilynn and Carl Thoma never before displayed in a museum, as well as important loans from the Newberry Library and Denver Art Museum—introduce visitors to explorers, artists, and patrons who lived in the Spanish-governed Andes during the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries.
The metaphorical guide of this journey is Antonio de Ulloa (1716–95), a Spanish naval officer and cartographer who traveled to South America with a French scientific mission in the 1730s and 1740s. His portrait introduces the group of works assembled—paintings of identified sitters, signal works by important South American artists, and devotional paintings that include historical figures. Each work has its own direct link to individual biography and lived experience in the New World, offering a more personal look at the themes of exploration and discovery and bringing to life the culture and artistic production in South America as European conventions combined with indigenous traditions.
The installation is accompanied by a bilingual brochure as well as bilingual treatment of all object labels, wall texts, and audio guide stops. Select works have also been added to the museum’s “Closer” app, featuring slide shows, videos, archival materials, and more for further insight into this unique period of cultural convergence.

00108,Alfred Stieglitz (American, 1864–1946) tirelessly promoted photography as a fine art. Through his own photographic work over the course of a half-century, the photographic journals he edited and published, and the New York galleries at which he organized exhibitions of photographs, paintings, and sculpture, Stieglitz showed photography to be an integral part of modern art in America. In a search for artistic ancestors, he looked intently at photography of the 19th century, most notably that of Julia Margaret Cameron and the Scottish duo David Octavius Hill and Robert Adamson. Their work resonated for Pictorialism, a movement that valued painterly, handcrafted images, and these earlier photographs were exhibited and reprinted for new audiences. Stieglitz’s fledgling interest to create a history of photography as an art form was also evidenced in his decision, later in his career, to revisit his own prior output, reprinting earlier images in a high modernist style.

The Stieglitz collection at the Art Institute includes several later Cameron and Hill and Adamson prints along with important works by Stieglitz himself, Edward Steichen, and other Pictorialist artists. Drawn entirely from the permanent collection, this exhibition examines how 19th-century photographs influenced Pictorialist practice. Fostering close looking at different photographic processes—from salt and albumen prints of the 19th century, to carbon prints and photogravures of turn-of-the-century reproduction, to crisp gelatin silver prints of the modernist period—it shows Stieglitz and his circle in the context of a changing photographic history.

00104,Of all the Impressionists who focused on modern life, Edgar Degas was the most dedicated to the classical tradition of depicting the human form, especially that form in movement and performance. In this focused exhibition, two exceptional loans—a remarkable painting from the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C., Scene from the Steeplechase: The Fallen Jockey, and a beloved sculpture from a private Chicago collection, Little Dancer Aged Fourteen—join other loans and paintings, drawings, pastels, and sculpture from the Art Institute’s permanent collection to explore the artist’s career-long fascination with the figure in motion through the subjects of the racetrack and ballet.
A striking canvas, Degas’s Scene from the Steeplechase: The Fallen Jockey marked a momentous transition for the artist from the classically inspired history paintings of his youth toward the depiction of subjects drawn from modern life. In the mid-1860s, when Degas premiered this work, the cross-country obstacle race known as the steeplechase had reached the height of its popularity, but the sport’s potential for danger also made it controversial. This highly dramatic image, possibly inspired by a recent tragedy, underscores the perils inherent to the race. Painted on a public scale, it nevertheless captures an intimate and unsettling moment. Is the jockey, for which Degas’s younger brother Achille served as the model, dead or merely fallen? The sense of immediacy evoked by the painting contrasts sharply with the artist’s own working method for the piece, which was complex and painstaking; Degas returned to the work over the course of nearly 30 years radically reworking both subject and brushwork. He reportedly deemed the painting “one of those works which are sold after a man’s death. . . . Artists buy them not caring whether they are finished or not.”
Degas’s fascination with Parisian cultural life extended also to the café concert, theatrical performances, and above all, the ballet. Like the steeplechase, the ballet existed to entertain the wealthy, and the artist paid for the privilege of going behind the scenes of the ballerina’s world. This intimate vantage point allowed him to capture what fascinated him most: the movement of the performer—caught in the poetry of the onstage illusion or backstage practice. That poetry is highlighted in this presentation by Little Dancer Aged Fourteen, a bronze cast from the original wax sculpture displayed at the sixth Impressionist exhibition in 1881. With her feet turned out, shoulders pressed down and back, and chin lifted high, her body brims with energy. That grace and athleticism, physical peril and transport—whether through the form of a young dancer, a robust singer, or a daring rider—come alive in the works selected for this intimate exhibition.

00115,When Vincent van Gogh decided to become an artist at the age of 27, he had already lived in 16 cities and had failed at five different professions. Though finally settled in his career, his home life was anything but—Van Gogh remained a wanderer until his death 10 years later, despite his dream of a permanent home. With each move, the change in environment took his artistic aesthetic in a new direction. 
To complement the exhibition Van Gogh’s Bedrooms, which explores the theme of home in the artist’s oeuvre, the Ryerson and Burnham Libraries present Van Gogh: In Search Of, a focused exhibition featuring photographs of the many residences and locales Van Gogh frequented over the course of his artistic career. 
The selection of images, drawn largely from the libraries’ own archives, were made possible by a friendship established between the Art Institute and the Van Gogh family in the 1940s. While preparing for a Van Gogh exhibition at the museum in 1949, Art Institute Director Daniel Catton Rich and Public Relations Counsel Peter Pollack visited the artist’s nephew, Vincent Willem van Gogh, to ask for a loan of many of his uncle's paintings for the show. A close friendship among the men developed, and the three of them set out to visit most of the sites captured by the famous artist in his fabulous paintings. These site visits were documented by Pollack, a trained photographer. This remarkable assemblage of images offers a unique glimpse into the artist's life seen through the lens of the photographer.
Please note: this exhibition is open on weekdays only. 

00103,One of the most renowned artists working today, Martin Puryear is celebrated for his elegant but playful sculpture and his devotion to craft. Lesser known is the extensive iterative process of drawing and printmaking that is essential to the artist’s studio practice. This exhibition is the first to draw back the curtain on that practice. Featuring over 100 drawings and prints as well as 12 sculptures—many borrowed directly from the artist and never displayed before—the presentation offers an unprecedented look into Puryear’s inspirations, methods, and transformative process.Martin Puryear has had a long relationship with Chicago and the Art Institute. He lived in the city for 12 years,  and the museum has long been supportive of his work—acquiring key pieces in the 1980s, organizing an extensive survey in 1991, and conserving many of his fire-damaged early prints and drawings after that show. Puryear has responded in kind, giving the museum a double-sided drawing for his sculpture Sanctuary and participating  generously and closely in the development of this exhibition, including loaning many works that he has never shared publicly before.Uniting these rarely seen drawings, several sculptures, and selections from his sketchbooks, Martin Puryear: Multiple Dimensions traces the artist’s career from his student days at Catholic University in the early 1960s through the present, with works created as recently as 2014. Critical to Puryear’s development were his formative years spent with the Peace Corps in Sierra Leone (1964–1966), a period in which he was inspired by and gave expression to buildings, flora, insects, animals, and children—the entirety of his environment. Since then, Puryear has returned to many of these themes, experimenting with scale, materials, and varying levels of abstraction. In the exhibition, visitors can witness  this evolution of thought—how a sketch of a house in Sierra Leone is transformed 10 years later into an abstracted proto-sculptural form, or how a head-like shape is reworked in bronze, wood, black Conté crayon, and graphite.By bringing to life the artist’s uncanny ability to make forms that are suggestive, playful, and transformative, all while remaining anchored in the world, this display of Puryear’s explorations across visual ideas and media offers a 360-degree view of the creative process of a contemporary master.

00112,The 1909 Plan of Chicago played a major role in the global history of urban planning and remains one of the largest and most comprehensive proposals for the transformation of an American city. Authored by architects Daniel H. Burnham and Edward H. Bennett with a committee of advisors from the Commercial Club of Chicago, the plan addressed issues common to many urban centers of this era, including insufficient infrastructure, the need for accessible green space, troubled class relations, and the lack of a strong civic image and identity for the city of Chicago.
The visual language of the plan has played a large role in its enduring legacy, including, most notably, a series of monumental watercolors created by the American artist and illustrator Jules Guérin. From Guérin’s sweeping bird’s-eye views of the city center and lakefront to maps proposing a commanding new geometry for Chicago’s urban fabric, the plan’s images constitute a powerful pictorial narrative about the nature and goals of urban change. Ultimately, the Plan of Chicago communicated the authors’ belief in the power of order and beauty to transform the everyday lives of Chicago residents, and by extension, all American citizens.

00102,This past December, we reopened our galleries of contemporary art, unveiling the largest gift in the Art Institute’s 136-year history: 44 iconic works by artists such as Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein, and Jasper Johns. Generously donated by Chicago collectors Stefan Edlis and Gael Neeson, these 44 paintings, sculptures, and photographs transform the museum’s presentation of contemporary art, bringing new depth and perspective to the Art Institute’s already strong holdings and making this collection the strongest of any encyclopedic art museum in the world.

The Art Institute has been committed to collecting and exhibiting contemporary art since the museum’s founding in the 19th century, when Impressionism was considered “contemporary.” Our rich collections today are largely the result of the generosity and vision of private collectors who have chosen to become great benefactors, and the Edlis/Neeson gift is the latest chapter in this long legacy of patronage and support.
Their gift charts the course of the most adventurous art movements since the 1950s, primarily in the United States, beginning with the work of Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg, and Cy Twombly, who began to forge a path out of Abstract Expressionism toward Pop Art with the use of images, materials, and techniques from mass media and found objects. Pop itself is represented in the gift by a landmark group of works by Andy Warhol—including two self-portraits—and signature works by Roy Lichtenstein. The collection also chronicles the significant and enduring influence of Pop Art on later generations of artists, including the virtuouso painter Gerhard Richter, the photography-based critiques of Richard Prince and Cindy Sherman, and the pop-culture riffs of Katharina Fritsch, Jeff Koons, and Takashi Murakami.
The Art Institute is a collection of collections, each compelling on its own terms yet capable of telling richer, more extraordinary stories when brought into dialogue. To be sure, the Art Institute of Chicago—and the stories we tell—have been made far greater by Stefan Edlis and Gael Neeson’s gift, an extraordinary benefaction to the city, and, indeed, to the world.

00110,The Art Institute’s Department of Textiles is fortunate to own a large collection, some 200 in all, of kesa, the rectangular or trapezoidal outer garment traditionally worn by Buddhist monks and priests in Japan. The textiles have been mostly acquired over the years by donations from various private collectors, but the largest group and many of the most significant pieces came from the collection of Ralph and Mary Hays in 2004. Although a few examples of our kesa have been displayed in the past, this is the first exhibition at the Art Institute to present an overview of this distinctive group of textiles.
Often described as a mantle or robe, the kesa is worn draped diagonally over the left shoulder and under the right armpit. The Japanese term kesa derives from the Sanskrit word kasaya (or turbulence, an allusion to the dyeing process) and indicates the garment’s Indian origin. Indeed, as a reminder of this origin and the historical Buddha’s own simple patched garment, kesa are formed from many fragments of the same cloth. Within each garment, the fragments are typically organized in a series of columns framed by a border with mitered corners. The number of columns, ranging from five to 25 but most often seven, indicates both the specific function of that garment and also the rank of the wearer within the religious hierarchy. Many examples are adorned with six added squares, usually from a different fabric, that reinforced points of stress from wear but have assumed symbolic value as well. Attached rings, loops, and cords helped hold the garments in place when worn.
Although there are earlier examples, particularly in Japanese temple collections, most surviving kesa date from the Edo period (1615–1868) and the Meiji period (1868–1912). The fabrics used during these periods are often highly patterned and made of sumptuous materials, in aristocratic defiance of the garments’ humble beginnings. Some of the fabrics are reused garments—Noh theatrical robes, kimonos, even Chinese robes—donated to temples by wealthy devotees. This selection of 23 kesa shows both the range and exquisite intricacy of this beautiful and historically rich garment.

Vincent van Gogh’s bedroom in Arles is arguably the most famous chambre in the history of art. It also held special significance for the artist, who created three distinct paintings of this intimate space from 1888 to 1889. This exhibition—presented only at the Art Institute of Chicago—brings together all three versions of The Bedroom for the first time in North America, offering a pioneering and in-depth study of their making and meaning to Van Gogh in his relentless quest for home.

Van Gogh painted his first Bedroom just after moving into his beloved “Yellow House” in Arles, France, in 1888. He was so enamored with the work, now in the collection of the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, that after water damage threatened its stability, he became determined to preserve the composition by painting a second version while at an asylum in Saint-Rémy in 1889. Identical in scale and yet distinct from the original, that second work is now one of the icons of the Art Institute’s permanent collection. Van Gogh created a smaller third version, now at the Musée d’Orsay in Paris, as a gift for his mother and sister a few weeks after making the second. While the three paintings at first appear almost identical, when examined closely, each reveals distinct and unique details.
This exhibition is the first to truly delve into the fascinating history of these three paintings. Beginning with Van Gogh’s early canvases of cottages and birds’ nests, the show explores the artist’s use of the motif of home—as haven, creative chamber, and physical reality—and follows the evolution of this theme throughout his career, beyond the Yellow House to the asylum at Saint-Rémy. The presentation concludes with Van Gogh’s final residence in Auvers-sur-Oise, where he once again painted a series of cottages—returning to the idea that first evoked in him a sense of home.
Van Gogh’s Bedrooms features approximately 36 works by the artist, including paintings, drawings, and illustrated letters, as well as a selection of books and other ephemera known to have been in Van Gogh’s possession. Enhancing the exploration of the artist’s works and his longing for a place of his own are several engaging interactive presentations. A digitally enhanced reconstruction of his bedroom allows viewers the chance to experience his state of mind and the physical reality of the space that so inspired him, while other enriching digital components bring to light significant recent scientific research on the three Bedroom paintings. The result is an innovative yet intimate look at one of the most beloved and often-misunderstood artists of all time.

00107,This innovative collaboration between the Department of Ancient and Byzantine Art and the Department of Prints and Drawings examines Renaissance and Baroque printmakers’ direct responses to Classical antiquity through the figure of Dionysos, the ancient Greek god of wine and theater. Installed in the Mary and Michael Jaharis Galleries of Greek, Roman, and Byzantine Art, this exhibition juxtaposes ancient sculpture with prints from the 15th through the 18th century with nearly 100 objects—pieces from the permanent collection, new loans of ancient art, and recently acquired works on paper.
Dionysos—known as Bacchus to the Romans—cavorted with an entourage of satyrs, the god Pan, and frenzied maenads, female followers of the god. All these devotees represented the untamed and hedonistic desires of humanity, which were unleashed by the intoxicating elixir of wine. Because performance was a part of the early Greek festivals of Dionysos, he also became known as the patron god of theater, an aspect of the deity that is less well known today. In ancient art, Dionysos could take many forms, from a graceful youth to a bearded mature man. During the Renaissance and Baroque periods, the time of early printmaking, interest in antiquity—especially Dionysos—flourished. Ancient sculptures depicting the god and his raucous retinue inspired artists to find new ways to transform age-old Dionysian subjects into prints and drawings that would appeal to their own contemporary audiences.
Anchoring the exhibition are Greek and Roman sculptures depicting Dionysos and his wild followers along with vessels used in ritual drinking parties and festivals honoring the god of wine and theater. Their printed counterparts are masterpieces from the Italian Renaissance to the French Rococo, including notably Andrea Mantegna’s Bacchanal with a Wine Vat, a 15th-century Italian engraving with striking visual similarity to the bronze Statue of Young Dionysos (a current long-term loan to the museum). Bringing together this rich selection of works, separated by as many as 1,500 years, this exhibition offers new, enticing insights into the art of Classical antiquity and its later revivals.

00113,The most ephemeral of all Japanese prints, fans with printed images of popular kabuki actors, beauties, and landscapes were ubiquitous in Japan during the Edo period (1615–1868). Most were well used, which is why so few remain. However, those that were not destroyed by being mounted as fans on bamboo sticks have been preserved as part of the Art Institute’s collection. Highlighted in this exhibition are fans' unique format, as well some of their less obvious uses—catching insects and as a fashionable way to feature calligraphy. Fans were produced in specialized shops. While the round fans (uchiwa) duplicated Chinese prototypes, the folding fan (ôgi), was invented in Japan in the seventh century. All of these fans, however, were refined by the skill of an artist and transformed into charming, lightweight accoutrements that brought relief from the heat, comfort to the soul, and delight to the eye. Fans printed with images of favorite kabuki actors were one of the earliest and most favored prints for theater lovers to own. With the popularization of the landscape print, Utagawa Hiroshige (1797–1858) produced more printed images for fans than any other artist, even though these likely number less than 10 percent (about 350 designs) of his entire output. Because these prints were trimmed and pasted to either folding or round fans, few have survived, and therefore it is difficult to understand the total number that may have existed.There will be a rotation of some of the works at the midpoint of the exhibition.

Visitors can arrange material samples and sketches to create a “mood board” (just like the professionals do) and consider how color, texture, and cultural context create a specific feel as well as how materials affect the way we experience architecture inside and out—from personal spaces to museum galleries to buildings in Chicago.

00203,Conceived as a complementary exhibition to Pop Art Design, The Street, the Store, and the Silver Screen celebrates the MCA’s holdings of seminal pop art. During the 1960s, many artists gravitated toward the brash colors, simplified designs, and direct salesmanship of the burgeoning commercial world and incorporated these same strategies into their fine art practices. Associated with the pop art movement, these artists shocked viewers by attacking the rarity, preciousness, and financial independence that traditionally embodied fine art. Today, however, these icons of pop art are recognized as reflecting a culture in transition, one that was beginning to fully embrace the capitalism and mass communication that characterizes global culture now.

The exhibition is organized around three separate themes that illustrate many artists’ interests during the 1960s and 1970s: the bustling energy of the street, with its preening passersby, garish signage, and automobile-centric organization; the commercialism that supported and surrounded mass produced consumer products; and the allure of Hollywood glamour and celebrity. Drawn from the MCA Collection and a handful of local loans, these works reveal patterns and preoccupations that connect artists working in otherwise distinct styles and approaches. In the “Street” section, for instance, photo books by Ed Ruscha are presented with a concrete Cadillac in a collage by Wolf Vostell and a colorful streetwalker in a painting by Ed Paschke. In the “Store,” Andy Warhol’s silk-screened “portraits” of Campbell’s soup cans are joined by papier-mache sculptures of candy by Claes Oldenburg and a painting of an alluring female nude on top of a zebra by Mel Ramos, mimicking an often-used sales strategy in advertising. In the “Silver Screen,” we find glamour of various stripes, including 1950s heartthrob Troy Donahue in Andy Warhol’s painting Troy Diptych and the underground siren pictured in Paschke’s technicolor painting Elcina. The exhibition reveals the richness of the MCA’s holdings in this area of art history as well as the continued relevance and fascination that pop art has for us today.

00202,While we may think we know pop inside-out through the well-documented and widely discussed work of Andy Warhol and his peers, the spirit of pop not only manifested itself in Warhol’s paintings of Marilyn Monroe and Campbell’s soup cans, it also influenced the look of chairs, sofas, lamps, and even architecture during the culturally ebullient 1960s and 1970s. Pop Art Design, an exhibition organized by the Vitra Design Museum, one of the preeminent furniture and design museums in the world, pairs iconic design objects with artworks from this celebrated era to show the cross-pollination between these creative worlds. This glimpse outside the precincts of fine art museums and galleries reinforces the pervasiveness of pop as a cultural phenomenon during this period. Designers such as Charles Eames, George Nelson, Ettore Sottsass, Achille Castiglioni, and Robert Venturi were just as enamored of the commercial buzz of Main Street as their fine art peers and equally embraced the banality of everyday objects, the vivid colors of advertising, and standardized fabrication at the heart of mass consumer products in the creation of their work. Their furniture, graphic design, and architecture exemplify the same pop spirit that swept the western world during this period, but have up until this point not received the attention they deserve. This exhibition, presented alongside a companion exhibition of classic pop works from the MCA collection, offers a fresh perspective on this prevailing period of cultural production.

00206,Surrealism: The Conjured Life presents more than 100 paintings, sculptures, drawings, and photographs that demonstrate the deep currents that Surrealism sent through the international art world—and especially through Chicago—since its emergence in the first half of the twentieth century. A global movement that encompassed a wide number of art forms, including film, theater, poetry, and literature, Surrealism came of age with poet André Breton’s formal declaration in 1924. This deeply emotional and psychological art form flourished in the 1930s and 1940s—turbulent times of economic instability, rapidly changing social mores, and war.

Chicago collectors brought the European visual arts aspect of Surrealism to their hometown. Joseph and Jory Shapiro and Edwin and Lindy Bergman traveled to Europe, where they met members of the Surrealist group including Paul Delvaux, Matta, and Magritte, piquing their interest in this “art of the irrational.” Mary and Earle Ludgin collected in depth the works of eccentric American painter Forrest Bess. These arts patrons were among the founders of the MCA, and when the museum began collecting in the mid-1970s, they donated major works by those we now consider “classical” Surrealists, forming an early and continuing collection strength. These artworks also proved inspirational to generations of Chicago-based artists, from the immediate postwar group dubbed the Monster Roster to the Hairy Who and others, a further expression of the continuing lure of “the conjured life” that results in strange, often magical, and sometimes disturbing, imagery.

Though often framed as a largely historical movement, the freedom afforded by Surrealism to explore both formal issues—including experimenting with new materials and techniques—and personal expression has continued to inspire artists to the present day. Thus besides presenting works by the founders of the movement, the surrealist tendency is traced in two other groupings: Surrealist-related works from the 1950s to the present, and Chicago connections. Artists including Balthus, Leonora Carrington, and Dorothea Tanning round out the presentation of the classical Surrealists. Major international contemporary artists such as Lee Bontecou, Mark Grotjahn, Wangechi Mutu, Cindy Sherman, and Francesca Woodman represent the stylistically diverse Surrealist-related grouping. Chicago-based artists on view include Gertrude Abercrombie, Leon Golub, Jim Nutt, Christina Ramberg, and H. C. Westermann.

The exhibition highlights one of the most traditional values in the visual arts: looking. All of the artworks that populate The Conjured Life bear close scrutiny, both in observing and exploring the subject matter and noting the various visual strategies and formal means, from the straightforward representation of Magritte to the low-relief plaster technique of Max Ernst; from the shamanistic deer skin, wood, and felt used by Jimmie Durham to the full-size rubber life raft cast in bronze by Jeff Koons.

The exhibition is presented in the Bergman Family Gallery, Lindy and Edwin A. Bergman on the museum’s second floor. 

00207,Longtime member of Chicago’s art community, Diane Simpson (American, b. 1935) makes distinctive sculpture that have gained recognition both nationally and internationally. Originating as a commission from the Racine Art Museum, Wisconsin, which occupies a former department store, Window Dressing was designed for the museum’s six street-level display windows. Four of these six tableaux make their Chicago premiere in this presentation. Each window display consists of an individual sculpture that evokes clothing and accessories set against a backdrop that incorporates the geometric patterns and streamlined curves of the Art Deco period. To seamlessly combine the sculptures with the backdrops, Simpson also crafted stands, platforms, hangers, and other display furniture. Simpson’s ambitious project pays homage to the pioneering window dressers of the early 20th century who developed the field of merchandise display.

Simpson’s manner of working has always been process-driven. She plays with abstraction, figuration, color, and form to create works that fuse material culture and fine art. Inspired by clothing from a wide variety of cultures and eras, Simpson carefully researches and renders these utilitarian items into two-dimensional drawings. She then realizes the final works—which in this presentation include a bowler hat and a woman’s pinafore—in three dimensions, often schematizing or exaggerating their original forms. Hand-constructing the sculptures from a wide range of materials, Simpson cuts, stitches, wraps, folds, ties, and rivets these items together to create the final pieces. To provide a glimpse into her working process, the exhibition also features research materials selected by the artist. They include trade manuals and journals of the 1920s and 1930s, as well as scale models for the some of the finished works.

The exhibition is organized by Lynne Warren, Curator at the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago.

The exhibition is presented in the Carol and Douglas Cohen Gallery and Stone Family Gallery, Ellen Stone Belic and Dr. Nenad Belic, Cynthia and Richard Raskin, Carole David Stone and James H. Stone on the museum’s fourth floor. 

00201,Puerto Rican–born artist Rafael Ferrer has worked in a broad range of forms since first emerging as a national and international figure in the late 1960s. During the heyday of avant-garde explorations in the late 1960s and early 1970s, Ferrer (who studied with such well-known Surrealist figures as Wifredo Lam and André Breton) was one of the prime instigators of a movement now called process art, which focused on the process of creating rather than on the resulting object. His early installations, featuring ephemeral materials such as leaves, quickly evolved into installations that were more narrative in nature and that included evocative, handcrafted artifacts such as the corrugated steel Kayak #2: Norte (1973). This sculpture is a central feature of the exhibition and acknowledges Ferrer’s birthplace on an island, as well as his many voyages away from his homeland. During this same period, Ferrer also fashioned maps and flags and began his ongoing series of vibrantly colored, highly imaginative paper bag faces, examples of whic are included in the exhibition to contextualize Kayak.

Another major feature of the exhibition is the colorful and powerful cycle of paintings Cien Años de Soledad (One hundred years of solitude) (1982), which illustrate Nobel Prize–winning writer Gabriel García Márquez’s extraordinary novel set in the author’s native Colombia, in the fictional town of Macondo. The founder of Macondo believes his town is really an island and alternates between feelings of isolation and wanderlust, imagining the possibilities beyond the island’s shores—a constant theme in Ferrer’s work. Painted in a direct and willfully naïve style, the Cien Años works are alluring because of their color and immediacy yet unsettling due to scale shifts and depictions of savagery and violence. 

The concentration of works by Ferrer in the MCA collection reflects the museum’s long association with the artist, including the MCA’s presentation of his 1972 solo exhibition, Tierra del Fuego (Land of fire), referencing a group of islands off the southern tip of South America named by explorer Ferdinand Magellan. A Flag for the Straits of Magellan (1972), a major work featuring a pennant of fabric on which the artist painted and affixed rawhide, bone, wire, pipe cleaners, and other materials, was a prominent part of this important early exhibition and was created especially for the MCA. In recognition of the MCA’s early support of Ferrer, his longtime friends and collectors Earl and Betsy Millard of St. Louis have given the museum many of the works on display.

MCA DNA: Rafael Ferrer is part of an ongoing exhibition series featuring iconic works from the MCA collection. This exhibition is organized by Lynne Warren, Curator at the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago.

The exhibition is presented in the McCormick Tribune Orientation Gallery on the museum’s second floor. 

00213,While Chicago art making has historically been strongly figural and representational, the Minimalism and conceptual art movements of the 1960s had a definite impact on many Chicago-based artists who emerged in the late 1980s and early 1990s. In the early 1980s there was a marked change in the Chicago art scene as the city’s art schools began attracting students and working artists from around the nation who had absorbed the lessons of the previous decades’ avant-garde and who were influenced by the theoretical writings of historians, philosophers, environmentalists, and literary critics. The following years saw a rise in the number of Chicago-based artists whose works were in the lineage of or consciously referred to conceptual art. The pioneering exhibition program at artist-run space Randolph Street Gallery (founded 1979) allowed many of the artists we now consider Chicago’s finest, such as Jeanne Dunning, Iñigo Manglano-Ovalle, Dan Peterman, and Tony Tasset, both to exchange ideas and to position their works in a broader social and cultural context. Galleries including Feigen Inc. and Feature showed work by these young artists alongside that of emerging national figures such as Charles Ray and Mike Kelley.

More than a dozen artists working in painting, photography, sculpture, and installation are represented in this exhibition, and their modes of abstraction are likewise diverse. Sculptors Richard Rezac and Tony Tasset use simple forms that emphasize the expressive qualities inherent in their industrial materials, while Dan Peterman, a pioneer in exploring environmental and sustainability issues, uses recycled materials to focus his conceptual and aesthetic concerns. Painters Julia Fish and Mitchell Kane abstract nature to an almost unrecognizable degree to create poetic canvases. Using photography, Jeanne Dunning focuses on the landscape of the body, and Iñigo Manglano-Ovalle maps the DNA of twins, both resulting in abstract portraits, while Gregory Green fashions a Minimalist grid out of saw blades in his kinetic installation. All of these artists employ the undeniable beauty of their materials and abstract compositions to convey complex ideas about art history, social issues, and identity.

MCA DNA: Chicago Conceptual Abstraction is part of an ongoing exhibition series featuring iconic works from the MCA Collection and is organized by Lynne Warren, Curator at the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago.

00204,Kathryn Andrews (American, b. 1973) examines how image producers—such as artists, corporations, Hollywood studios, and politicians who mirror and shape social values at large—employ visual cues and material packaging to elicit desire. In doing so, she often calls attention to our power, or lack of power, to resist such forces and the complicated act of looking itself. Her sculptures, installations, and performances sample the aesthetics of pop art, minimalism, and conceptualism as readymades, and reinscribes them into new narratives about gender, class, and race.

Kathryn Andrews: Run for President, the artist’s first solo museum exhibition in the United States, features the sculptures that have made her one of the crucial new voices of her generation. For this exhibition, Andrews situates her sculptures against a conceptual and, at times, pictorial backdrop of presidential elections that functions as a rich allegory. The linear narrative explores candidates, campaigns, sitting in office, and the end of presidency, charting the rise and fall of the president—a metaphorical double for the figure of the artist as well as the viewer. Revealing cultural connections that are both humorous and critical, while questioning the consequences of seeing anything as fixed, Andrews demonstrates how meanings are always contingent and in flux.

This exhibition is organized by Julie Rodrigues Widholm, former Curator at the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago.

The exhibition is presented in the Bergman Family Gallery, Lindy and Edwin A. Bergman on the museum’s second floor. 

00212,The 1960s were important years for artists and friends Andy Warhol (American, 1928–1987) and Marisol (Marisol Escobar, American, b. France, 1930), and marked a formative period in the development of their individual careers. Warhol began using his celebrated silk screen techniques to produce serial paintings, often based on mass media images. Marisol made the first of many portraits and developed her signature style, wooden sculptures with flat painted surfaces and additional elements such as everyday objects or plaster castings. Both were prominent figures in New York City’s lively art scene during this time. The two attended events together and each exhibited their work in solo shows at Eleanor Ward’s Stable Gallery as they came to be identified with the rising pop art movement. Warhol and Marisol even turned to one another as occasional subjects: Marisol made a sculptural portrait of Warhol in the early 1960s, titled Andy; and around the same time, Warhol featured Marisol in some of his early, and now legendary, films.

Inspired by the multifaceted relationship of these two artists, MCA DNA: Warhol and Marisol presents a focused selection of their works, side-by-side, drawn primarily from the collection of the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago. Key examples of Warhol’s silk screen paintings and Marisol’s wood sculptures illuminate the artists’ respective approaches to portraiture while the pairing of their work brings certain affinities into view, including a similar use of repeating figures. At the same time, their methods diverge in significant ways, perhaps most visibly in the contrast between Warhol’s overtly mechanical approach to painting and Marisol’s more handcrafted, labor-intensive techniques as a sculptor.

MCA DNA: Warhol and Marisol is organized by MCA Curator Lynne Warren and MCA Curatorial Assistant Karsten Lund.

00208,British artist Phil Collins's (b. 1970) work may seem lighthearted at first, but his sensitive explorations of the interconnectedness among diverse individuals have earned him serious attention, including a Turner Prize nomination. In 2004 he travelled to Bogotá and assembled a group of musicians to record a note-for-note instrumental version of the Smiths’s 1987 album The World Won’t Listen. Collins then advertised citywide in radio ads and print media, inviting Smiths fans to perform karaoke versions of their favorite songs. The block-print posters Collins used—similar in design to posters used for political rallies or boxing matches—are included in the exhibition. Colombians showed up in droves to Collins’s recording sessions, and el mundo no escuchará presents a compilation of their passionate performances in front of a series of scenic backdrops. 

A first-generation Smiths fan himself, Collins traces the group’s enduring impact across the world in this work, the first in a trilogy of Smiths karaoke videos (the artist made subsequent versions in Turkey and Indonesia) that reveal the universal appeal of the band’s moody pop sensibility and their ability to capture teenage angst and alienation. Though many of the singers are not fluent in English, the album’s lyrics are not lost on them—as evidenced by their moving and vulnerable renditions. During the intimate and transformative act of singing, the karaoke performers transcend language barriers to embody the pathos, signature melancholy sound, and gestures of the band’s lead singer, Morrissey. 

el mundo no escuchará makes visible the wide range of emotions the camera provokes, including embarrassment, failure, honesty, sincerity, self-consciousness, anxiety, and sentimentality. Simultaneously revealing pop culture’s ubiquity and the personal meaning each song holds for the performers, Collins contributes to a larger movement in contemporary art—one in which questions of performance intersect with trajectories of identity formation, self-expression, and confession.

This exhibition is organized by Michelle Puetz, former Andrew W. Mellon Postdoctoral Fellow at the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago.

It is presented in the Turner Gallery on the fourth floor.

00211,MCA DNA: Alexander Calder traces the development of the artist’s ideas over a 50-year career, in particular, his exploration of how art can move in response to its physical environment. The exhibition presents examples of Alexander Calder’s (American, 1898–1976), mobiles, stabiles, and works on paper dating from the 1920s to the 1970s—a selection of the museum’s in-depth holdings of the seminal artist’s work. The core of this collection comes from the Ruth and Leonard Horwich Family Loan, which Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago has housed, cared for, and displayed since 1995. The Horwich family were, and remain, preeminent collectors of surrealist and Chicago Imagist art; and, as some of the founders and earliest supporters of MCA Chicago, helped to build the museum’s collection.

Trained as an engineer, Calder applied his knowledge of mechanics to colorful abstract shapes. Activated by air currents, his dynamic mobiles are ever-changing compositions. Marcel Duchamp invented the word mobile to describe Calder’s revolutionary work. Even Calder’s Flamingo (1973)—located in Chicago’s Loop—and his other static sculptures, dubbed stabiles by Jean Arp, evoke movement as they invite viewers to contemplate them from every angle.

The city of Chicago was important to Calder. In 1935, the Renaissance Society and the Arts Club of Chicago hosted one of his early solo exhibitions in the United States. The Horwich family amassed a significant Calder collection, befriending the artist and ultimately acquiring more than two dozen of his artworks. In 1974, as part of the inaugural ceremonies for Flamingo, then-Mayor Richard J. Daley declared a “Calder Day,” and Calder was carried to the sculpture’s dedication by a circus-themed parade on State Street. As part of these festivities, the MCA mounted a major Calder exhibition, and his art has been a steady presence in the museum’s galleries ever since.

MCA DNA: Alexander Calder is part of an ongoing exhibition series featuring iconic works from the MCA Collection and is organized by Michael Darling, James W. Alsdorf Chief Curator at the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago.

00210,Richard Hunt (American, b. 1935), a longtime resident of Chicago and one of the city’s most accomplished artists, has contributed significantly to the history of abstract sculpture. Hunt turns eighty in 2015, and the MCA celebrates his life and artistic achievements with an MCA DNA exhibition of his sculptures and drawings, dating from the 1950s through the 1990s. These works reflect the development of Hunt’s style—from smaller objects made of welded scrap materials to monumentally scaled metal sculptures. Throughout his career, Hunt has used bronze and steel in his sculptures to explore lyrical forms, the sublime possibilities of abstraction, and the reconciliation of the organic and the industrial. Presenting a selection of Hunt’s drawings as well, the exhibition highlights his cultivation of linear gestures and a sense of movement in his work in both media.

Hunt’s career, which spans more than fifty years and continues today, began with early success, at the time largely unprecedented for a young artist. The Museum of Modern Art, New York, acquired one of Hunt’s sculptures in 1957, when he was still a student at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, and mounted a retrospective of his work in 1971, when Hunt was only thirty-five. Hunt has received a Guggenheim Fellowship, fifteen honorary degrees, and a Lifetime Achievement Award from the International Sculpture Center, New Jersey. In addition, he has completed more than 120 major public commissions around the US and Chicago is home to thirty-five of his public sculptures, including works at Midway Airport and the historic State of Illinois Building. Hunt’s exhibition at the MCA is accompanied by an interactive map locating his public commissions, as well as a new video, produced by the MCA, that features Hunt discussing his work.

This exhibition is organized by Naomi Beckwith, Marilyn and Larry Fields Curator at the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago.



00215,MCA DNA: William Kentridge is part of an ongoing exhibition series featuring iconic works from the MCA Collection. Acclaimed for his work in animated film, visual art, theater, and opera, Kentridge had his first survey exhibition in the United States in 2001 at MCA Chicago. From this exhibition, the MCA acquired more than a dozen drawings and two of his best-known films: Felix in Exile (1994) and History of the Main Complaint (1996), both of which will be on view. The drawings featured in the exhibition are those used to make this latter film—charcoal sketches that Kentridge erased and reworked to create the memorable segments that depict his alter egos and their struggles in late and post-apartheid Johannesburg: Felix Teitlebaum, the romantic artist who is always shown nude, and Soho Eckstein, the self-absorbed, wealthy mine owner and land developer who always wears a pinstriped suit. Although he is best known for his short animated films, Kentridge considers the activity of drawing the basis of his work. He has stated, “I believe that in the indeterminacy of drawing, the contingent way that images arrive in the work, lies some kind of model of how we live our lives. The activity of drawing is a way of trying to understand who we are and or how we operate in the world. It is in the strangeness of the activity itself that we can detect judgments, ethics, and morality.”

Like much of Kentridge’s work, History of the Main Complaint addresses issues of memory, truth, and reconciliation—issues that gripped South Africa in the immediate post-apartheid period, during which the Truth and Reconciliation Commission held public hearings to recover lost histories, to make reparations to those who had suffered, and to provide amnesty.

Also on view is the torn-paper collage Portage (2000), which features pages from a vintage French-language encyclopedia as its background. Created specifically for the catalogue that accompanied the MCA’s 2001 exhibition of the artist’s work, this collage depicts the march of variously weary, stalwart, and exuberant characters in silhouette and is a poignant commentary on the human condition, rooted in the dramatic events of South Africa’s recent history. This will be the first showing of Portage in its entirety.

This exhibition is organized by Lynne Warren, Curator at the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago.

00205,Brazilian artist Alexandre da Cunha (b. 1969) is a poet of found materials. Rarely making objects from scratch, Da Cunha instead finds wondrously creative ways to repurpose already-existing items, revealing their inherent if overlooked form, beauty, and mystery. For a 2013 exhibition at the MCA, Homebodies, Da Cunha fashioned an undulating wall made with mop heads that mimicked a midcentury modern architectural feature. He has also performed this alchemy with straw hats, plastic soda bottles, umbrellas, and striped awning fabric. For the MCA’s ongoing Plaza Project series, Da Cunha presents objects of a more urban scale to address this particular site.

Mix (Americana) (2013) is a full-scale cement mixer liberated from its typical location on the back of a delivery truck. Cleaned up and set on the plaza as an object of beauty, this red-white-and-blue vessel is not only meant to inspire double-takes for visitors passing through the area, it also functions as a strange, quasi-kaleidoscopic viewing device: when viewers peer into its open end, complex shadows, forms, and the depth of the interior chamber are revealed as sunlight filters down into the barrel through a hole in the top. Da Cunha is also exploring the use of precast concrete sewer pipes—like those coursing underneath Chicago—to make artistic arrangements from the different sizes and shapes that are available to the construction trade.

Da Cunha’s activation is the fifth MCA Plaza Project. The series previously featured work by Yinka Shonibare, MBE (2014), Amanda Ross-Ho (2013), Martin Creed (2012), and Mark Handforth (2011).

This exhibition is curated by Michael Darling, James W. Alsdorf Chief Curator at the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago.

The exhibition is presented on the Efroymson and Hamid Family Sculpture Plinth and on the museum’s plaza. 

00209,The Los Angeles–based architecture firm Johnston Marklee, founded by Sharon Johnston and Mark Lee, have been hired by the MCA to create a master plan for the museum, which includes a redesign and relocation of the restaurant as well as other public spaces. To coincide with the inaugural Chicago Architecture Biennial, Johnston Marklee have designed an intervention in the museum’s current café space that refers to the predominant grid of the building’s original architect, Josef Paul Kleihues, and hints at some ideas being considered for the renovations to come. Inaugurated in 1996, the MCA building was designed on a rigorous grid-based logic which not only influenced the proportions of the spaces inside the building, but also the rhythms of the fenestration and cladding on the exterior. Johnston Marklee’s immersive installation further emphasizes the proportions of this grid system by applying a repeating square graphic on the café walls, as well as creating a gridded ceiling plane that cuts the double height space in half, making for a more intimate scale. This dropped ceiling plane alludes to one idea Johnston Marklee are considering in their redesign of the space, where a mezzanine floor may be inserted into this space to create rooms for art making and meetings above and a social engagement space below. One characteristic of Johnston Marklee’s approach to the masterplan and restaurant project is a deep respect and understanding of the Kleihues building and this intervention for the Biennial is consistent with that rapport.

The installation is presented in the ComEd Lakefront Café on the museum's second floor.

00214,Part of an ongoing exhibition series featuring iconic works from the MCA Collection, MCA DNA: John Cage is presented on the occasion of the artist’s centenary year. It traces the fruitful and decades-long relationship between the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago and this celebrated avant-garde composer and artist. Cage supported the museum from the very beginning, performing in a work with fellow Fluxus collaborators Dick Higgins and Allison Knowles as part of the October 1967 opening celebration of MCA Chicago’s inaugural exhibition, Pictures to be Read/Poetry to be Seen. Over the years Cage returned numerous times to Chicago, where he had lived in the early 1940s, often stopping at the MCA to execute various projects or see friends. Other artists also frequently performed Cage’s works at the MCA, notably the pioneering video artist Nam June Paik and cellist Charlotte Moorman in a 1969 program titled “Mixed Media” that featured Variations III and 26’1.1499” for a String Player.

Perhaps his best-known project associated with the MCA was part of the 1982 New Music America festival. For this pioneering music festival, administered by the MCA, Cage realized A Dip in the Lake: Ten Quicksteps, Sixty-two Waltzes, and Fifty-six Marches for Chicago and Vicinity (1978), a score created on a map of Chicago. Materials demonstrating how to interpret the score of this important work, which later entered the MCA Collection, are on view along with scores and books drawn from the more than 80 items associated with Cage in the MCA Artists’ Books Collection. Ephemeral materials, such as letters written to MCA staff and other historical documents that trace Cage’s legacy at the MCA, are also displayed.

This exhibition is organized by Lynne Warren, Curator at the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago.

00327,Louisiana heiress and philanthropist Matilda Geddings Gray (1885–1971) acquired her first object by Fabergé in 1933. An artist herself, with a refined aesthetic sensibility, she was a sophisticated collector, while the name of the Russian artist-jeweler Peter Carl Fabergé (1846–1920) was almost unknown in the United States. Over the following years, Matilda Geddings Gray amassed one of the finest Fabergé collections in the world, and Fabergé's art has become widely known and internationally sought after.
A selection of works by Fabergé from Matilda Geddings Gray's sumptuous collection is on long-term loan at The Metropolitan Museum of Art, and comprises this exhibition. Objects originally commissioned by and created for the Romanov family, such as the Lilies-of-the-Valley Basket—the most important Fabergé work in a U. S. collection—and three magnificent Imperial Easter Eggs, are on view. The exhibition will display works from the collection on a rotating schedule for five years. Iconic works from the House of Fabergé have not been on public view in New York since 2004.
            
                After Matilda Geddings Gray died in 1971, her collection passed to the foundation she had established, with the stipulation that a broad public should be able to enjoy it. The collection was on view for many years at the New Orleans Museum of Art and at the Cheekwood Botanical Garden and Museum of Art in Nashville. Earlier this year, the rare Imperial Napoleonic Egg and Lilies-of-the-Valley Basket from the collection were featured in the exhibition Fabergé Revealed at the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, Richmond.
Peter Carl Fabergé (1846–1920) was a talented artisan and jeweler but also a visionary. In 1872 he took over his father's small atelier in Saint Petersburg and within forty years transformed it into the world's largest enterprise of its kind, employing some five hundred craftsmen and designers. During the 1870s Peter Carl Fabergé had ongoing and open access to the world-renowned collections of the Hermitage for cataloging, repairing, and restoring precious pieces, particularly ancient gold pieces of jewelry. In 1882, at the Pan-Russian Exhibition held in Moscow, he was awarded the gold medal for his accurate replicas of those objects, drawing the attention of the czar and of the Imperial family. In 1885 the House of Fabergé was nominated "Goldsmith by special appointment of the Imperial Crown" and received the commission for the first Imperial Easter Egg. The firm rapidly grew to become the largest jewelry enterprise in Russia, and from 1882 to 1917 (when the Russian Revolution brought an end to the Fabergé production), the House of Fabergé produced thousands of objects ranging from silver tea sets to objets de luxe. The artisan died in Lausanne, Switzerland, in 1920.
The exhibition features three of the fifty Imperial Easter Eggs created for the Romanov family by Fabergé beginning in 1885. Records show that the eggs were initially commissioned by Czar Alexander III for his wife, Maria Feodorovna, and then by his son and heir, Czar Nicholas II, for his mother and his wife. The creation of each Imperial Easter Egg required the work of many people—designers, gem cutters and setters, engravers, enamelers, polishers—and each could take more than a year to complete. The three Imperial Easter Eggs on view include the Imperial Danish Palaces Egg, which Czar Alexander III presented in 1890 to his wife, and which is divided into twelve sections in opalescent pink enamel with diamonds, emeralds, and sapphires. It opens to reveal a surprise folding ten-panel screen that bears miniatures of the Empress's favorite Danish and Russian retreats. The Imperial Caucasus Egg, an opulent piece adorned with diamonds, pearls, crystal, and ivory, has four oval doors, each of which opens to reveal a different miniature view of Abastuman, the imperial hunting lodge in the Caucasus Mountains. And the Imperial Napoleonic Egg, which Czar Nicholas II presented to his mother, the dowager empress Maria Feodorovna, on Easter 1912, commemorates the centenary of the Russian victory over the armies of Napoleon, revealing a folding six-panel screen with miniatures showing the six regiments of which the dowager empress was an honorary colonel.
Another highlight of the exhibition is the Lilies-of-the-Valley Basket, considered to be Fabergé's floral masterpiece. It is the most important piece by the artisan in any collection in the United States. Made in 1896, it was originally presented to Czarina Alexandra Feodorovna and consists of nineteen individual stems emerging from nine separate plants in a "moss" of spun, fused, clipped, and polished green and yellow gold. Each pearl blossom is edged in silver set with rose-cut diamonds, with realistic leaves made of hard, dense nephrite and carved with the striations characteristic of the lily-of-the-valley plant. The czarina adored the Lilies-of- the-Valley Basket, as the blossoms were among her favorite flowers, and pearls her favorite jewels. She kept it on view in the private apartments and often took it with her when traveling.

00302,Elisabeth Louise Vigée Le Brun (French, 1755–1842) is one of the finest eighteenth-century French painters and among the most important of all women artists. An autodidact with exceptional skills as a portraitist, she achieved success in France and Europe during one of the most eventful, turbulent periods in European history.
In 1776, she married the leading art dealer in Paris; his profession at first kept her from being accepted into the prestigious Académie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture. Nevertheless, through the intervention of Marie Antoinette, she was admitted at the age of 28 in 1783, becoming one of only four women members. Obliged to flee France in 1789 because of her association with the queen, she traveled to Italy, where in 1790 she was elected to membership in the Accademia di San Luca, Rome. Independently, she worked in Florence, Naples, Vienna, St. Petersburg, and Berlin before returning to France, taking sittings from, among others, members of the royal families of Naples, Russia, and Prussia. While in exile, she exhibited at the Paris Salons.
She was remarkable not only for her technical gifts but for her understanding of and sympathy with her sitters. This is the first retrospective and only the second exhibition devoted to Vigée Le Brun in modern times. The eighty works on view include paintings and a few pastels from European and American public and private collections.
00326,Over the last forty years, the Metropolitan's collection of Chinese painting and calligraphy has grown to be one of the greatest in the world. Replete with masterpieces dating from the Tang dynasty (608–917) to the present, the collection encompasses the vast historical sweep of the brush arts of China, from meticulous court painting to fiercely brushed dragons to lyrical paintings by scholars.
This exhibition, presented in two rotations, will highlight the gems of the permanent collection in a chronological display, with an emphasis on works from the Song (960–1279) and Yuan (1271–1368) dynasties.
00322,The traditional East Asian lunar calendar consists of a repeating twelve-year cycle, with each year corresponding to one of the twelve animals in the East Asian zodiac. This Lunar New Year, which begins on February 8, 2016, is the Year of the Monkey. In celebration, the Metropolitan Museum is pleased to present this small exhibition in the Charlotte C. Weber Galleries for the Arts of Ancient China, featuring depictions of monkeys in various media—including painting, ceramics, metalwork, and jade carving.
The earliest-known record of these zodiac animals is from China's Eastern Han Dynasty (25–220 A.D.) and dates to the first century. In sequence, the twelve animals are: rat, ox, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, ram, monkey, rooster, dog, and pig. Each animal is believed to embody certain traits expressed in the character of the people born in that year. People born in the Year of the Monkey are thought to be intelligent, energetic, and playful.
The monkey has been a popular decorative figure in Asian art for over two millennia, often serving as a rebus or visual pun conveying the notion of academic success or accomplishment. In a fan painting from the late twelfth century that depicts three gibbons raiding an egret's nest, the gibbon acts as a visual pun, because the Chinese word for gibbon (yuan) is a homophone for "first place in the civil exam." Similarly, in a porcelain plate from the late seventeenth or early eighteenth century, a depiction of monkeys conveys a wish for high rank, as the Chinese word for monkey (hou) is a homophone for "marquis," or "commander."
The Chinese lunar calendar and its associated iconography eventually spread to Korea, Japan, and Chinese communities throughout Southeast Asia. While the symbolism of the Chinese lunar calendar is distinct to East Asia, images of monkeys, characterized by intelligence, lively spirit, and mischievous behavior, have universal appeal and are found in the decorative art of many cultures around the globe.
00304,This special display of instruments made by three generations of the Sax family marks the bicentenary of the birth of Adolphe Sax. Rare saxophones, brass instruments, and an exquisite ivory clarinet are among the twenty-six instruments selected to showcase the inventions and innovations of this important family.
There are few instrument makers who have become a household name. The eponymous instruments of Adolphe Sax have had a wide-reaching impact on music and society. Patented in 1846 and conceived as a military band and orchestral instrument, the saxophone is now integral to many different types of music around the world. Through jazz and pop, it achieved the type of universal popularity matched by few other instruments. During Sax's life, military and band music were transformed by saxhorns, his innovative family of brass instruments. The saxhorn fueled the brass band movement, which opened up music making to the working classes. Modern day euphoniums, tenor horns, and baritones are all descendants of the saxhorn family. 
The bicentenary of Adolphe Sax's birth also marks the 125th anniversary of the gift of over 3,600 instruments to the Met by the pioneering collector Mary Elizabeth Adams Brown. Sax was also an avid collector, active during a formative period of musical instrument scholarship. Many important instrument collections were established during his lifetime, including the one at the Metropolitan Museum. Sax and Brown circulated in the same international community of scholars and collectors, and instruments made by the Sax family featured prominently in Brown's collection as examples of cutting-edge instrument design. They continue to inspire performers, composers, and instrument makers.
00312,This exhibition reveals the most sumptuous moment in late nineteenth-century America—a period known as the Gilded Age—through the work of some of the most noted design firms at the time. The centerpiece of the three-part exhibition is the opulent Worsham-Rockefeller Dressing Room from the New York City house commissioned by art collector and philanthropist Arabella Worsham (later Huntington; ca. 1850–1924). A complete work of art, with its elaborate woodwork and decorations, it is a rare surviving commission by the New York–based cabinetmaker and interior decorator George A. Schastey (American, 1839–1894).
Although little known today, Schastey operated a large and successful decorating firm in the late nineteenth century, catering to some of the nation's wealthiest individuals. Loans from public and private collections will highlight his work and important role; some of these works are newly attributed to him and have never before been on public view. The exhibition will also include furniture by some of Schastey's contemporaries.
An adjoining gallery will display works by Schastey's best-known competitor, Herter Brothers, that were created for the firm's most important commission, the William H. Vanderbilt House. In total, the exhibition will include more than three dozen examples of furniture from America's Gilded Age. Visitors will gain new insights into the luxurious and artistic interiors found in New York's wealthiest households in the late nineteenth century.
00321,In the early 20th century, the arts of medieval Iran and Syria attracted unprecedented interest in the West. Demand by museums and collectors—especially for figural and highly decorated works—promoted commercial and research excavations, and led to the custom of repairing, filling in, and enhancing fragmentary and deteriorated examples.
The exhibition will consider the legacy of such practices 100 years later, as it compares archaeological artifacts with those that were refurbished, forged, or imitated.
00323,This exhibition features eight quilts—all recent additions to the Museum's outstanding quilt collection, only one of which has been shown at the Museum before. The display also includes a selection of folk painting and furniture from The American Wing's collection, as well as two important paintings by Edward Hicks (American, 1780–1840), on loan from the Peter J. Solomon Family Collection.
The current group of quilts will remain on view through January 8, 2016, at which time a new selection of quilts will be installed. The second rotation will be displayed through August 7, 2016.
00309,This installation of drawings, prints, and related ephemera by the German artist and performer Matthias Buchinger (1674–1739) explores for the first time the oeuvre of the so-called Little Man of Nuremberg. Standing only twenty-nine inches high, and born without hands or feet, Buchinger was celebrated in his own time as a draftsman and calligrapher as well as a magician and musician. He boasted a clientele that included noblemen, kings, and emperors, along with members of the public who visited him at inns and fairs from Leipzig to Paris and from London to Belfast.
Buchinger's remarkably delicate drawings often exploited flowing lines of microscopic texts to build up figures and elaborate scenes, an ancient Jewish technique known as micrography. The vast majority also incorporate calligraphic inscriptions that describe his physical condition as well as his artistic and personal triumphs. His main subjects include family trees, coats of arms, the Ten Commandments, and portraits. The works on display are drawn primarily from the collection of the master conjurer and author Ricky Jay. Framing them are works on paper from the Met's collection, dating from the late Middle Ages to the present day, that artfully play with words or typography.
00306,This installation, the thirteenth since the Joyce and Robert Menschel Hall for Modern Photography opened in 2007, is a snapshot—not comprehensive, but representative—of the collecting interests of the Department of Photographs through recently acquired works made by fifteen artists over the last seven years. While the title is taken from a photograph in the exhibition, the concept of reconstruction chimes with many of the works, which can be viewed, at least in part, as indirect addresses to how perception and cognition are being remapped to accommodate our newly bifurcated existences—online and "in real life."
The notion that we swim in a sea of photographic images that shape how we see ourselves and the world felt new in 1989 and prescient in 1968, but with the rise of the Internet and social media, this condition is so obvious as to be useless. With one foot in cyberspace and the other on an unstable terrain of accelerated change, our daily life and deepest subjective recesses—our relationship to ourselves, each other, and to things—is constantly being reconstructed along digital lines, with cameras serving as almost bodily appendages to interface between these two realities. In this context, the seamless digital “restoration” of dazzle camouflage to a WWII battleship, the viral spread of Photoshop mishaps in an interior view, or the simple folding back of a book page can be seen as complex negotiations between the old order and the new networks that silently and invisibly are shaping individual and collective experience.
00307,When the Department of Far Eastern Art was established at the Metropolitan in the summer of 1915, the Museum possessed only sixty-five Korean works. Some were mistakenly catalogued as Chinese or Japanese. Dubbed the "hermit kingdom," Korea was then little known to the Western world. Today, its traditional arts, as well as pop music, film, and drama, are celebrated markers of global culture. The Museum's collection of Korean art, too, has been significantly transformed and continues to evolve. It now encompasses ceramics, paintings, sculpture, metalwork, lacquer ware, and textiles from the late Bronze Age to the present. 
Works on view include important recent gifts to the Museum from the Mary Griggs Burke Collection and Florence and Irving Collection—including a rare sixteenth-century Buddhist painting of royal commission, a striking mid-seventeenth-century gilt-wood statue of a Bodhisattva, and exquisite mother-of-pearl inlaid lacquer boxes from the Joseon dynasty (1392–1910). The stories behind the objects in this exhibition capture the individuals and trends that shaped the Met's distinctive collection, sometimes deliberately, sometimes accidentally. This presentation also reveals the modern Western imagination of Korea, and the many ways Korean art came to be viewed and appreciated in America.
00336,This exhibition will illuminate the key role that the Holy City played in shaping the art of the period from 1000 to 1400. While Jerusalem is often described as a city of three faiths, that formulation underestimates its fascinating complexity. In fact, the city was home to multiple cultures, faiths, and languages. History records harmonious and dissonant voices from many lands. Persians, Turks, Greeks, Syrians, Armenians, Georgians, Copts, Ethiopians, Indians, and Europeans passed in the narrow streets of a city not much larger than midtown Manhattan. This will be the first exhibition to unravel the various cultural traditions and aesthetic strands that enriched and enlivened the medieval city.
Over two hundred works of art will be gathered from some sixty lenders worldwide. Nearly a quarter of the objects will come from Jerusalem. Among these are key loans from the city's many religious communities, some of which have never before shared their treasures outside their walls. Every People Under Heaven will bear witness to the crucial role that Jerusalem has played in shaping world culture, a lesson vital to our common history.
00329,The Metropolitan's collection of Nepalese and Tibetan art has recently been transformed by a series of major gifts. This installation features both promised and recently gifted works that are now integrated into the newly refurbished galleries—including an important twelfth-century Tibetan bronze Padmapani, a thirteenth-century bronze Vajravarahi, an important sixteenth-century Tibetan Hevajra mandala tangka, and a spectacular brass stupa (chorten). The Nepalese Gallery has been enriched by a large polychromed wood sculpture of the Goddess of Dance (Nrtyadevi). These works reflect the generosity of Steve and Sharon Davies, Florence and Herbert Irving, Ann and Gilbert Kinney, and the Zimmerman family.
00320,This exhibition, mounted in celebration of gifts both donated and promised to the Met, gathers works by Alex Katz (American, born 1927), one of our era's most acclaimed artists. Acquired through the generosity of Glenn Fuhrman, Leonard A. Lauder, and Katz himself, these works—eight in total, including two loans—span nearly the entire arc of Katz's career and include drawings, prints, and paintings. Among the works are two cutouts, the innovative artistic device that Katz pioneered in the late 1950s; a haunting cityscape; several portraits of Ada, Katz's wife and long-time muse; and portraits of luminaries from Katz's own social and artistic circles. 
Katz was born in Brooklyn in 1927 and came of age as an artist during the heyday of the New York School. In the late 1950s, he began to develop his mature style, one characterized by elegance, simplicity, and stylized abstraction. Committed to depicting recognizable motifs, Katz minimizes details and shading, choosing instead to summarize his subjects with the help of bold contours, blocks of color, and strategic swipes of the brush. As much as they represent a specific person or place, Katz's works also depict the act of seeing itself—that is, the peculiar mechanics of viewing, whether from afar or close up, whether on an empty street or across a crowded room. He captures the surprise and suspense, the desire and pleasure, that accompany the experience of spectatorship.
00308,Time is all around us, displayed on our phones and computers. Today, almost nobody needs to own a watch or a clock to tell the time. Access to the right time is not the luxury it once was. Yet the fascination with clocks and watches persists, and the thriving market for mechanical timekeepers is deeply aware of their history. Clocks and watches have always been about more than just telling time: they have been treasured as objects of desire and wonder, personal items imbued with value that goes beyond pure functionality. As works of art, they represent the marriage of innovation and craftsmanship.
This exhibition explores the relationship between the artistry of the exterior form of European timekeepers and the brilliantly conceived technology that they contain. Drawn from the Museum's distinguished collection of German, French, English, and Swiss horology from the sixteenth through the nineteenth century, the extraordinary objects on view show how clocks and watches were made into lavish furniture or exquisite jewelry. 
The creation of timekeepers required that clockmakers work with cabinetmakers, goldsmiths and silversmiths, enamelers, chasers and gilders, engravers, and even those working in sculpture and porcelain. These craftsmen were tasked with accommodating internal mechanisms by producing cases that, in both shape and function, adapted to timekeeping technologies. Their exteriors are often as complicated as the movements they house. Examining the dialogue between inside and out, adornment and ingenuity, The Luxury of Time reveals the complex evolution of European clockmaking and the central place of timekeepers in the history of decorative arts.
00311,This focus exhibition presents the findings of a recent study of the Crucifixion and Last Judgment paintings (ca. 1440–41) by Jan van Eyck and his workshop. These paintings and their frames have undergone technical investigations in an effort to solve long-standing mysteries about them. Whether the paintings were always intended as a diptych, or whether they were originally the wings of a triptych or the doors of a tabernacle, has been in question. The answer may be found not only in a closer look at the frames, but also in the relationship of the Metropolitan's Crucifixion painting to a recently rediscovered drawing of the Crucifixion attributed to Jan van Eyck (ca. 1390–1441) that has been acquired by the Boijmans Van Beuningen Museum in Rotterdam, and is also on view in the exhibition.
New infrared reflectography now affords an opportunity to compare the underdrawings of the Crucifixion and Last Judgment paintings with the Rotterdam drawing. In addition, X-radiography of the paintings' frames has revealed another text, albeit very damaged and fragmentary, on the flat part of the frame beneath the gold overpaint. The text is in Flemish, in Gothic miniscule script, as opposed to the Latin pastiglia (raised lettering) on the interior cove of the two frames. This introduces new clues regarding the original form and function of the two paintings, as the exhibition demonstrates.
00334,One of the most productive periods in the history of the region from Iran to Anatolia (Turkey) corresponds to the rule of the Seljuqs and their immediate successors, from 1038 to 1307. The Seljuqs were a Turkic dynasty of Central Asian nomadic origin that in short time conquered a vast territory in West Asia stretching from present-day Turkmenistan, Iran, Iraq, Syria, and Turkey. The lands controlled by the Seljuqs were not a unified empire, but controlled by various branches of the Seljuqs and their successor dynasties (Rum Seljuqs, Artuqids, Zangids, and others). Under Seljuq rule, the exchange and synthesis of diverse traditions—including Turkmen, Perso-Arabo-Islamic, Byzantine, Armenian, Crusader, and other Christian cultures—accompanied economic prosperity, advances in science and technology, and a great flowering of culture within the realm.
This landmark international loan exhibition will feature spectacular works of art created in the eleventh through thirteenth century from Turkmenistan to the Mediterranean. Approximately 270 objects—including ceramics, glass, stucco, works on paper, woodwork, textiles, and metalwork—from American, European, and Middle Eastern public and private collections will be shown. Many of the institutions have never lent works from their collections before. Among the highlights will be a dozen important loans from Turkmenistan, marking the first time that Turkmenistan as an independent country has permitted an extended loan of a group of objects to a museum in the United States.
Under the Great Seljuqs of Iran, the middle class prospered, spurring arts patronage, technological advancements, and a market for luxury goods. In contrast, in Anatolia and the Jazira (northwestern Iraq, northeastern Syria, and southeastern Turkey)—which were controlled by the Seljuq successor dynasties—art was produced under royal patronage, and Islamic iconography was introduced to a predominantly Christian area.
Furthermore, a number of artists had immigrated to the region from Iran in response to the Mongol conquest in 1220. Because patrons, consumers, and artists came from diverse cultural, religious, and artistic backgrounds, distinctive arts were produced and flourished in the western parts of the Seljuq realm.
00330,This tribute to a great collector reveals the distinctive features of Japanese art as viewed through the lens of fifty years of collecting: the sublime spirituality of Buddhist and Shinto art; the boldness of Zen ink painting; the imaginary world conjured up by the Tale of Genji and classical Japanese literature; the sumptuous colors of bird-and-flower painting; the subtlety of poetry, calligraphy, and literati themes; the aestheticized accoutrements of the tea ceremony; and the charming portraiture of courtesans from the "floating world" (ukiyo-e).
00317,Heber R. Bishop's collection of carved jades was formed in the last quarter of the nineteenth century and bequeathed to the Metropolitan Museum in 1902. Consisting of over one thousand pieces—primarily Chinese jades of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, as well as jades from Mughal India—it was the first major collection of its kind in the country. This exhibition features a selection of the finest examples from this renowned collection and celebrates the hundredth anniversary of the Department of Asian Art.
00319,This installation, which explores the cultural importance of silk in China, showcases the most important and unusual textiles from the Museum's collection. In addition to three rare pieces dating from the Tang dynasty (618–906), when China served as a cultural hub linking Korea and Japan to Central and West Asia, and ultimately to the Mediterranean world, the exhibition also includes eleventh- and twelfth-century tapestries from Central Asia, as well as contemporaneous Chinese examples of this technique.
Spectacular embroideries—including an imperial fourteenth-century canopy decorated with phoenixes and flowers, and a monumental late seventeenth- or early eighteenth-century panel showing phoenixes in a garden—are also on view, together with theatrical garments, court costumes, and early examples of badges worn at court to designate rank.
00331,This exhibition addresses a subject critical to artistic practice: the question of when a work of art is finished. Beginning with the Renaissance masters, this scholarly and innovative exhibition examines the term "unfinished" in its broadest possible sense, including works left incomplete by their makers, which often give insight into the process of their creation, but also those that partake of a non finito—intentionally unfinished—aesthetic that embraces the unresolved and open-ended. Some of history's greatest artists explored such an aesthetic, among them Titian, Rembrandt, Turner, and Cézanne.
The unfinished has been taken in entirely new directions by modern and contemporary artists, among them Janine Antoni, Lygia Clark, Jackson Pollock, and Robert Rauschenberg, who alternately blurred the distinction between making and un-making, extended the boundaries of art into both space and time, and recruited viewers to complete the objects they had begun.
Comprising 197 works dating from the Renaissance to the present—approximately forty percent of which are drawn from the Museum's own collection, enhanced by major national and international loans—this exhibition demonstrates The Met's unique capacity to mine its rich collection and scholarly resources to present modern and contemporary art within a deep historical context.
00315,"Prints throw open to their students with the most complete abandon the whole gamut of human life and endeavor, from the most ephemeral of courtesies to the loftiest pictorial presentation of man's spiritual aspirations." —William M. Ivins
This exhibition commemorates the centenary of the Department of Prints at The Metropolitan Museum of Art by celebrating the astounding legacy of its founding curator, William Mills Ivins, and his brilliant protégé A. Hyatt Mayor. Together, during their combined fifty-year tenure, Ivins and Mayor amassed a collection of many hundreds of thousands of prints that is both encyclopedic in its scope and studied in its many areas of focus.
By drawing on its own vast holdings, this exhibition reveals how the Met's print collection was artfully constructed according to the vision of Ivins and Mayor—both social historians and amateur print specialists. The exhibition will show how the print collection of the Museum was meant to be like a library, composed from the beginning as a corpus of works (not all distinctly masterful works of art) that describe, in the most comprehensive way, man's aspirations. It will display the most beautiful, rare, and exceptional prints alongside the equally important popular and ephemeral works that were collected in the first fifty years of the department's history. The exhibition tells the story of this great American collection through prints by Andrea Mantegna, Marcantonio Raimondi, Albrecht Dürer, Rembrandt van Rijn, Jacques Callot, Francisco de Goya, James McNeill Whistler, Mary Cassatt, Edward Hopper, Honoré Daumier, Edward Penfield, and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, to name just a few artists in the exhibition.
The Power of Prints explores how the evolution of curatorial priorities—notably from purely aesthetic concerns to those of content and context—affected the building of the department's remarkable stock of etchings and engravings. The exhibition also, like Ivins and Mayor, approaches printed matter as the first entrée into the information age, as functional objects that were meant to spread information to an ever-widening public and, in turn, to reflect the changing aspects of any given society.
00332,One of the most significant artists to emerge in post-Independence India, Nasreen Mohamedi (1937–1990) created a body of work that demonstrates a singular and sustained engagement with abstraction. Her minimalist practice not only adds a rich layer to the history of South Asian art but also necessitates an expansion of the narratives of international modernism. The Met Breuer exhibition, the first museum retrospective of the artist's work in the United States, is an important part of the Met's initiative to explore and present the global scope of modern and contemporary art.
Mohamedi mainly worked with gestures of pencil and ink on paper, experimenting with organic forms, delicate grids, and dynamic, hard-edged lines. Her cosmopolitan outlook enabled her to draw upon a range of aesthetic sensibilities, from the poetry of Rilke and Camus, as well as Indian classical music, to the modernist architecture of Le Corbusier's Chandigarh.
Spanning Mohamedi's entire career and bringing together more than 130 paintings, drawings, photographs, and rarely seen diaries, the exhibition traces the conceptual complexity and visual subtlety of the artist's oeuvre.
00328,Sol LeWitt (American, 1928–2007) executed drawings by hand throughout his life; in 1968 he extricated his work from the confines of the frame and transferred it directly to the wall. The wall compositions were designed for limited duration and maximum flexibility within a broad range of architectural settings. Initially executed by drafters, these works in their finished state were most often slated for destruction. A seminal practitioner of Conceptual Art, LeWitt emphasized the creative idea that generates a work of art, as opposed to the work's material existence. "For each work of art that becomes physical," he wrote, "there are many variations that do not."
Sol LeWitt's 1982 Wall Drawing #370: Ten Geometric Figures (including right triangle, cross, X, diamond) with three-inch parallel bands of lines in two directions was installed at the Museum over a period of four weeks. The drawing (a detail of which is at left) will be on view in its complete state through January 1, 2017, when it will be painted over.
00316,Dramas presented during religious festivals in southern India are an important aspect of popular Hindu celebration. This exhibition highlights five rare wooden sculptural masks that represent a largely unrecorded category of late medieval Indian devotional art. The masks depict the protagonists in a deadly battle between Vishnu in his man-lion avatar, Narasimha, and an evil king whose destruction was essential for the restoration of order in the universe.
00313,The Burdick baseball card collection constitutes an integral part of The Metropolitan Museum of Art's collection of ephemera and tells the history of popular printmaking in the United States. In 1947, after having approached A. Hyatt Mayor, the Museum's curator of prints and photographs, the Syracuse electrician Jefferson R. Burdick (1900–1963) began to donate his entire collection of approximately thirty thousand baseball cards in large batches, along with another 270,000 trade and postcards, to the Museum.
The baseball cards collected by Burdick date from 1887 to 1959 and represent the most comprehensive collection outside of the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York. The cards on view illustrate the history of baseball from the dead-ball era at the turn of the nineteenth century through the golden age and modern era of the sport.
The baseball cards document the sport through various types of media—from lithography to photography—and imagery illustrating legends as well as the lesser-known players, owners, and teams that have contributed to the history of the game.
00305,Throughout her career, South African photographer Jo Ractliffe (born 1961) has directed her camera toward landscapes to address themes of displacement, conflict, history, memory, and erasure. This exhibition brings together selected works from three of her recent photographic series that focus on the aftermath of the Angolan Civil War (1975–2002) and its relationship with the Border War (1966–89) fought by South Africans in Angola and present-day Namibia. For Ractliffe and many other South African civilians, Angola during these wars was an abstract place, a "secret, unspoken location where brothers and boyfriends were sent as part of their military service." When seen consecutively, these three series reveal Ractliffe's deepening engagement with the region's complex histories as an attempt to "retrieve a place for memory."
The earliest series, Terreno Ocupado (2007–8), was produced during Ractliffe's first visit to Angola's capital, Luanda, five years after the end of the Civil War. These images highlight the structural instability of the capital's shantytowns and question what it means for land to be occupied, abandoned, and struggled over. While working on As Terras do Fim do Mundo (2009–10), Ractliffe traveled alongside ex-soldiers returning to the desolate places in the Angolan countryside where they had fought. The Borderlands (2011–13) examines the impact of the wars in Angola within South Africa's borders. For this most recent project, she photographed militarized landscapes that had been occupied by the South African army, tracing histories of displacement that began during the colonial and apartheid periods and continue to unfold today.
The photographs in all three series were originally produced as either gelatin silver prints or archival pigment prints on cotton paper; the inkjet prints on display here were made by the artist specially for this exhibition.
This exhibition has been organized to coincide with Kongo: Power and Majesty, which focuses on works created by artists in present-day Angola between the sixteenth and nineteenth centuries.
00303,From the first millennium B.C. until the arrival of Europeans in the sixteenth century, artists from the ancient Americas created small-scale architectural models to be placed in the tombs of important individuals. These works in stone, ceramic, wood, and metal range from highly abstracted, minimalist representations of temples and houses to elaborate architectural complexes populated with figures. Such miniature structures were critical components in funerary practice and beliefs about an afterlife, and they convey a rich sense of ancient ritual as well as the daily lives of the Aztecs, the Incas, and their predecessors.
This exhibition, the first of its kind in the United States, sheds light on the role of these objects in mediating relationships between the living, the dead, and the divine. It also provides a rare look at ancient American architecture, much of which did not survive to the present day. Some thirty remarkable loans from museums in the United States and Peru join works from the Metropolitan Museum's permanent collection, which is particularly rich in this material.

00335,The Costume Institute's spring 2016 exhibition, presented in the Museum's Robert Lehman Wing and Anna Wintour Costume Center, will explore how fashion designers are reconciling the handmade and the machine-made in the creation of haute couture and avant-garde ready-to-wear.
With more than 120 ensembles, dating from an 1880s Worth gown to a 2015 Chanel suit, Manus x Machina will look into the founding of the haute couture in the 19th century, and the emergence of a distinction between the hand and machine at the onset of industrialization and mass production. It will re-examine the dichotomy in which the hand and the machine are presented as discordant tools in the creative process, and question the significance of the distinction between haute couture and ready-to-wear.
The Robert Lehman Wing galleries on the Museum's first floor and ground level will present a series of case studies contrasting haute couture and ready-to-wear ensembles to unravel the hand/machine conundrum. Traditional métiers of the haute couture, including embroidery, featherwork, artificial flowers, pleating, lacework, and leatherwork will be presented alongside innovative processes, such as 3D printing, circular knitting, computer modeling, bonding and laminating, laser cutting, and ultrasonic welding.
The Anna Wintour Costume Center galleries will resemble a traditional maison de couture with ateliers of tailoring and dressmaking. Toiles and prototypes will be presented as garments in the making.
00318,Lacquer, the resin of a family of trees found throughout southern China—as well as in Southeast Asia, Korea, and Japan—is an amazing material. When exposed to oxygen and humidity, lacquer hardens or polymerizes, becoming a natural plastic and an ideal protective covering for screens, trays, and other implements. Mixed with pigments, particularly cinnabar (red) and carbon (black), lacquer has been also used as an artistic media for millennia.
This installation, which features all of the most important examples of Chinese lacquer in the Museum's collection, explores the laborious techniques used to create scenes based on history and literature, images of popular gods and mythical and real animals, and representations of landscapes and flowers and birds.
00333,The conquests of Alexander the Great transformed the ancient world, making trade and cultural exchange possible across great distances. Alexander's retinue of court artists and extensive artistic patronage provided a model for his successors, the Hellenistic kings, who came to rule over much of his empire. For the first time in the United States, a major international loan exhibition will focus on the astonishing wealth, outstanding artistry, and technical achievements of the Hellenistic period—the three centuries between Alexander's death, in 323 B.C., and the establishment of the Roman Empire, in the first century B.C.
This exhibition will bring together some 264 artworks that were created through the patronage of the royal courts of the Hellenistic kingdoms, with an emphasis on the ancient city of Pergamon. Examples in diverse media—from marble, bronze, and terracotta sculptures to gold jewelry, vessels of glass and engraved gems, and precious metals and coins—reveal the enduring legacy of Hellenistic artists and their profound influence on Roman art. The ancient city of Pergamon (now known as Bergama, in present-day Turkey) was the capital of the Attalid Dynasty that ruled over large parts of Asia Minor.
The exhibition represents a historic collaboration between the Metropolitan and the Pergamon Museum in Berlin, whose celebrated sculptures will comprise approximately one-third of the works on view. Numerous prominent museums in Greece, the Republic of Italy, other European countries, Morocco, Tunisia, and the United States will also be represented, often through objects that have never before left their museum collections.
00310,Only three decks of European hand-painted playing cards are known to have survived from the late Middle Ages. These include The Cloisters Playing Cards, which will form the core of this small exhibition highlighting one of the more intriguing works of secular art from The Cloisters Collection. Examples of cards from the earliest hand-painted woodblock deck as well as fifteenth-century German engraved cards, north Italian tarot cards of the same period, and the finest deck from the early sixteenth century will complete the display. Collectively, the figures and scenes depicted on these cards reflect changing worldviews during a period of tumultuous social, economic, and religious change, charting the transition from late medieval to early modern Europe.
00325,Iconographic analysis and scientific testing have revealed new information about the meaning and use of two textiles in the Museum's collection. The first—woven in a loop pile meant to suggest a mosaic—has recently been recognized as a wall hanging for Christian liturgical use. The second—five recently acquired elements from a depiction of the Crossing of the Red Sea as described in the book of Exodus—can be understood as being from a wall hanging for Christian or possibly Jewish use.
00324,In 1911, Emily Johnston de Forest gave her collection of pottery from Mexico to the Metropolitan Museum. Calling it "Mexican maiolica," she highlighted its importance as a North American artistic achievement. De Forest was the daughter of the Museum's first president and, with her husband, Robert, a founder of The American Wing. The De Forests envisioned building a collection of Mexican art, and, even though their ambitions were frustrated at the time, the foundational gift of more than one hundred pieces of pottery anchors the Met's holdings. Today, more than a century later, their vision resonates as the Museum commits to collecting and exhibiting not just the arts of Mexico, but all of Latin America. This exhibition highlights the early contributions of the De Forests and others, and presents recent additions to the collection for the first time.
00301,This Costume Institute exhibition focuses on the internationally renowned style icon Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, whose originality and elegance established her as one of the most celebrated fashion personas of the twentieth century. The thematic show features about sixty ensembles of haute couture and ready-to-wear primarily from de Ribes's personal archive, dating from 1962 to the present. Also included are her creations for fancy-dress balls, which she often made by cutting and cannibalizing her haute couture gowns to create nuanced expressions of her aesthetic. These, along with photographs, video, and ephemera, tell the story of how her interest in fashion developed over decades, from childhood "dress-up" to the epitome of international style.
A muse to haute couture designers, de Ribes had at her disposal their drapers, cutters, and fitters in acknowledgment of their esteem for her taste and originality. Ultimately, she used this talent and experience to create her own successful design business, which she directed from 1982 to 1995. While the exhibition focuses on her taste and style, extensive documentation from her personal archives illustrates the range of her professional life, including her roles as theatrical impresario, television producer, interior designer, and director and organizer of international charity events.

00314,Since The Metropolitan Museum of Art was founded in 1870, the institution's physical space and collection have grown and its curatorial departments have diversified. The first Asian works of art to enter the collection—mostly ceramics and lacquers—were acquired in 1879 and originally accommodated in what was then called the Department of Decorative Arts. Only in 1915 was a separate Department of Far Eastern Art established, and it was not until 1986 that its name was changed to the Department of Asian Art. The timeline presented in the photographs in this exhibition chronicles the changing face of the Met's galleries of Asian art as the building's footprint has expanded, exhibition styles have evolved, and the collection has grown.
Forever a work in progress, the Met's collection of Asian art is ultimately the product of the passion and scholarship of the many collectors, curators, donors, dealers, and directors who have together shaped the Museum's holdings and legacy.
00505,Bruce Davidson (American, b. 1933) is one of the most influential photographers of the last half century. Working in both color and black and white, Davidson has documented subjects ranging from the civil rights movement to the urban grit of Harlem and the New York subway system. This exhibition presents a selection of 42 photographs and celebrates important gifts of vintage prints that will be exhibited for the first time since their acquisition in 2013. 
00504,This world premiere retrospective of Oscar de la Renta’s work celebrates the life and career of one of fashion’s most influential designers.
